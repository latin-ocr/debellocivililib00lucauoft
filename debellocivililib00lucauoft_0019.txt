THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xvii

mand of P. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, consul in 49; fifteen
cohorts were from the army of Gaius Antonius whom Pompey's
lieutenants, M. Octavius and L. Scribonius Libo, had compelled
to capitulate in Corcyra Nigra <Cur20la)1, seven from the beaten
and disbanded army of Afranius in Spain3 and last but not least
were the two legions which Scipio had brought from Syria2.
The horsemen included 600 Galli or Galatians commanded by
Deiotarus their tetrarch, 300 from the same district under the
command of Castor³ and Domnilaus, 500 under Ariobarzanes
from Cappadocia, 500 under Sadalas, the son of Cotys, from
Thrace, 200 Macedonians under the command of the able
Rhascypolis, 500 Gauls and Germans from Egypt, where Gabi-
nius had left them to protect king Ptolemy Auletes, 200 from
Commagene furnished by Antiochus, whom Pompey had restored
to his kingdom, 800 drawn from the slaves and shepherds of
Pompey and his friendS, and unspecified numbers from the
Dardani and Bessi, mountain tribes in the skirts of HaemuS,
from Macedonia, Thessaly and the vicinity4. His corps of bow-

elsewhere. Of the auxiliary'forces, of whom the major part came

included levies from most os the Greek States and from every
portion of the East Mediterranean, even Hebrews and Arabs,
and contingents from Eastern and Western Armenia⁵. The
