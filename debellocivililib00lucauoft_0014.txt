xii HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

stantial accuracy appears to have been overlooked. He has
committed no geographical error in 'placing Pholoe in Thessaly1‚
nor any historical one in the mention of Spanish targeteers
among the forces engaged at Pharsalia2. The inundation of the
Enipeus, to which little prominence is given in his narrative, is
confirmed by collateral and independent evidence³; ancl the
striking correctness of his account of the decisive charge of
Caesar’s reserve appears to warrant us in removing a corruption
which disfigures a portion of the description4.

On the other hand we might reasonably expect him to know
the occasion of his hero's first triumph⁵‚ and not to assign to
his favourite birds the tastes of carrion crows⁶. More than
once too he mars his own workmanship by a failure to realize
the expressions that he employs⁷.

It would appear then that, so far at least as Lucan's account
of Pharsalia is concerned, the praise onStoffel is too strong: 'Z-
‘ Or Lucain merite ici toute creance ; car lorsqu'il ne s'agit que
de rapporter les faits (nous ne disons: quand il s'agit de les
juger), le poete de Cordoue se montre un historien des plus
veridiques' (Histoire de Jules Ce'sar, Guerre Civile, vol. 11.,
p. 2 51). Others however have erred in the opposite direction.

§2 T be authorities of Lucan.

As Lucan was no eye-witness or contemporary of the events
which he narrates, whatever verity his narrative possesses it
must owe entirely to the sources from which it was derived.

¹ 827 n.

2 232, where the emendation of Omnibonus Celtas for cetras is
entirely mistaken.

3 224, 226 and notes, and below p. xxiv, n. 3.

4 522 (see note and Crit. App.) and below p. xxvi. It may be
added that the description of Pompey’s voyage from Lesbos in book
V111 is excellent, as Mr Parry has observed.

⁵ 14 n.

⁶ 83² n.
