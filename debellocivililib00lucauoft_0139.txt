462—3. I am glad to find myself to a certain extent in agreement
with C. Μ. Francken Mnemosyne (n. series), vol. 22 p. 166, who reads
‘ inde manus spectant uoltusque ac noscere quaerunt‚’ comparing for the
corruption 11 193 where M reads ac noscendus for agnoscendus. He

places 462 before 463, in which he reads ‘quo sua pila cadant et quae
sibi fata minentur.' The sense thus obtained is a very fair one: but it
may be doubted whether the MS variants can be thus explained ; and
the preponderance of evidence, as already said, is in favour of a different

order of lines.
