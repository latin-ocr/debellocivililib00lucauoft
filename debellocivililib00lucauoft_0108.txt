68 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

513. ‘ Pellets fused by travel through the air with their mass
melted by the heat.’ He means to convey that they must pass through
a certain ‘ extent of air‚' spatio aene, before the heating of their maSS,
calido pondere, can produce the effect in question. This is not an
exaggeration of Lucan’s. The ancients from Aristotle onwards believed
it happened3 e.g. Ov. Met. 14. 825 Sq· ‘sic lata plumbea funda Ι missa
solet medio glans intabescere caelo.’

521. prlma, through the attack on the rear·

522. obliquas, i.e. not parallel to the ῃ frons, but placed behind the
regular ‘ three lines' *at an angle in order to resist a side attack. This

523. latus and uagus ‚agree well with the last quoted words of
Caesar. “

524 sqq. Cf. Caesar's words ‘celeriter procucurrerunt infistisque
szssgnis tanta ui in Pompei equites impetum fecerunt ut eorum nemo consis-
teret omnesque conuersi non solum Ioco excederent sed protinus incitati
fuga montes altissimos peterent? non motis, i.e. kept in their place.

525. inmemores pugnae. H. compares the Homeric addi-ess
ἀνέρες ἕστε φίλοι ,μνήσασθε .δέ θούριδος ἀλκῆς. timendi, apparently
x gerund.

526. fecere palam ⁴ showed that,' the ,active expression corres-
ponding to eratpalam, cf. 133, 279.

529. in caput effusi ‘ headlongg' ef. Livy 27. 19. ιο ‘ prolapso
equo effusum in praeceps) ‘ Over the horse’s head ' would be super, or
per, caput.

530 sq. glomerata, no longer uaga (523). nubes, cf. Sil. It.
6. 33 ‘nubes densa Laconum‚' Livy 35. 49. 5 ‘ rex peditum equitumque
nubes iactat,’ Hom. ll. 4. 2'74 ἅμα δὲ νέφος εἵπετο πεζῶν. praeceps,

532. perditur, modum, cf. VIII 492 ‘sublatusque modus gladiis,' the

...pugna, cf. Quint. Curt. 4. 15. 32 ‘iamque non pugna sed caedes erat?

533. bella has a touch of irony, cf. 306 11. The passage is
perhaps parodied by Juvenal 3. 289 ‘rixae‚ Ι si rixa est ubi tu pulsas,
ego uapulo tantum.’

537. mutentur ‘stained’; ef. Claud. Stil. 1. 133 ‘flumina quae
largo mutastis sanguine fluctus.’

538. luc numerus ‘their numbers,’ a common ‘ attraction.'
