90 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

ffi'st. ff Latin Lz'terature, 303. 9) appears to have made a text for
Lucan, just as Mauortius (ib. 477. 3) consul A.D. 527 did for Horace and
other writers. To M and U, as it would appear from interna] evidence,
B and E, which agree together very closely (with C), should be added
as also representing the Pauline text. ΙΙ. the ‘non-Pauline' group
includes V and G and gives a different, and on the whole an inferior
text. The palimpsest fragments, which are three centuries older than
Paulus, show a text which differs considerably from the ‘ Pauline ¹.’

The texts which these manuscripts severally give are not quite pure.
In other words they show traces of mixture through the introduction of
readings from other sources than those they were immediately derived
from.

The text which may be elicited from a comparison of these readings
(for though M is perhaps the best, no one of them can be followed
exclusively) is not without corruption. It is however better than that

of many Latin writers.

DIGEST OF READINGS.

When more than one reading is cited, that standing first is the
reading of the text. The small letters denote readings introduced by
correction into the manuscripts3 e.g. m denotes corrections in M. In
such cases the original reading is, where necessary, indicated by 1 placed
above the line, thus Ml. ed. denotes conjectures by the present editor.
ad loc. means the explanatory notes.

2 luctzflcos Burmann, perhaps rightly, as otherwise it is natural to join
numquam magis with aethera contra, which cannot be right. With
Lucan however the argument is not conclusive. 3 currumque EGb,
possibly right. 28 populis MBE, populo Vl, populi UGv some edd„
taking pares as a verb ‘ whence get?' 43 edere, sor which U has odere,
ΜῙΒ1 sedere, seems corrupt. It cannot be taken either as (1) ‘used
up ' (consumpsere) ‘ all the grief ' they were allowed to show (Ov. Met.
13. 540 is different) or as (2) ‘mumbled' ‘did not let out.’ clausere
(or clusere) ‘ shut in' would express the sense required (for which we
may compare 1 2 57 sqq„ 20 sq.) and is not far from the letters, as cl

¹ Dr Hosius in his genealogieal tree of the relations of the codices (praestatio p.
xix) makes MBC direct descendants of the copy of Paulus, while UG are partly
derived from V. It is certainly not easy to explain the relation of the readings os our
mss to a ‘ Pauline' original in many passages of vn, e.g. 130, 154, 180, 303, 503, 530,
751, 796, 816-
