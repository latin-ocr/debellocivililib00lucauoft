58 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

385 sq. procurrunt. Cf. Livy 35. 5. 2 ‘ne certaminis studio
procurrerent priusquam datum signum esset,' 1v 772 sq. ‘neque enim

licuit procurrere contra Ι et miscere manus.’ The statement is only true
of the Caesarian line 3 see Introd. p. xxviii. motu irarum ‘tumult of
passion,' cf. Lucr. ‘irarum fluctus.' For ira cf. 103 n.

387. facient. The sense of damnum must be got out of ex-
pleat—reparet. quidquid, a word of which Lucan is fond, seems
here to be due to a straining after exact expression, ‘an amount of
mischief which no age can repair, whatever tlzat may be‚’ ‘the full total
that'; cf. VIII 179 sqq. ‘quidquid descendet ab arbore summa Ι
Arctophylax propiorque mari Cynosura feretur, Ι in Syriae portus tendet
ratis‚' ‘by the exact amount that Arctophylax sinks b‘elow the mast head
—will the ship move towards Syria.'

389. ut, concessive. For the punctuation see Crit. App.

390. Pharsalia will be fatal to multitudes yet unborn, who would
have been the children and descendants of the men cut off in that
battle. aeui ueniamus 1n orbem, a strange phrase if it means (ι) ‘the
generation coming into the world’ as we say, and hardly less strange if
it means (2) ‘time revolving in a circle,' i.e. the whole cycle of ages.
(The doctrine of cycles of time was a Stoic one, Zeller Stoics &a p. 1 16.)
Perhaps Lucan's language was influenced by some reminiscence of the
scene described by Virgil Aen. 6. 748—-760 ς cf. especially the phrase
‘ ubi mille rotam uoluere per annos ' compared with Silius It. 6. 121 ‘rota
uoluitur aeui.' In VIII 622 sqq. future ages in all parts of the world
are said to watch Pompey's murder ‘saecula Romanos numquam
tacitura labores Ι attendunt aeuumque sequens speculatur ab omni Ι orbe
ratem Phariamque fidem.'

391. natale for natali perhaps here only in literature but more than
once on inscriptions. reret ‘carry off,’ Virg. Ecl. 5. 34 ‘te fata
tulerunt.'

392. ‘The whole Latin race will be a name.' Latinum nomen
‘the Latin stock.' So Caeninum nomen Livy Ι. 10, Volscum nomen
ib. 2. 35, Romanum nomen Ov. Met. 1. 200 etc.; and in other con·
nexions Virg. Aen. 10. 618 ‘nostra deducit origine nomen' (cf. T arquata
nemina, inf. 584 n.). Lucan may have in his mind the nomen Latinum
as distinguished from the socz'z‘ in the earlier history of Rome; but see
below. fabula, cf. Pers. 5. 152 ‘cinis et manes et fabula fies-³ Ga.-
b108‚ H. quotes Hor. Ep. 1. 11. 7 ‘ Gabiis desertior atque Fidenis.’

Veios. It is somewhat strange to find this Etruscan city,
for whose overthrow Rome rather than Pharsalia was responsible,
