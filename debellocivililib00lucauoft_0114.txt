74 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

618. mortibus, dat. There follows a butcher’s catalogue. Tine
Roman taste for such descriptions was in part the effect of the
gladiatorial shows.

619 sq. letiferum has a strong emphasis, ‘ who is killed outright.’

uolnus, what wounds, i.e. the weapon, cf. V111 384 ‘ et quo ferre
uelint, permittere uolnera uentis’: for the use of the abstr. cf. mortes
517 n. exierit ‘issxk‘unChed” cf. 1v 201 sq. ‘qua lancea dextra}
exierit! calcet, in his death convulsions. Ovid Met. 12. 390 sq. is
much worse than Lucan.

621 sq. ‘Who with the outrush of his life drove out the sword
buried in his throat as he faced the foe.' An incredible occurrence which
is frequently mentioned ; 111 590 sq. ‘utrasque simul largus cruor expulit
hastas Ι diuisitque animam’ 3 Ov. Met. 13. 393 sq. ‘nec ualuere manus
infixum educere telum 3 Ι expulit {pse cruor’3 Senec. Oed. 1064 ‘ferrumque
secum nimius eiecit cruor.' anima. (Crit. App.) ‘life-blood,’ as
111 640 sq. ‘discursusque animae diuersa in membra meantis Ι inter-
ceptus aquis’; Virg. Aen. 9. 349. The Stoics regarded the soul (anima)
as fed by vapours from the blood, Zeller Stoz‘cs &a

623. membra, here ‘arms,' so seemingly 111 431 ‘in sua crede·
bant redituras membra secures‚' and probably Prop. 2. 28. 11 ‘an con·
tempta tibi Iunonis membra (templa MSS) Pelasgae ?' (of λευκώλενος Ἥρη).

624. transmittant ‘let the missiles pass through,' cf. Sil. It. 2. 118
‘calamumque uolantem, Ι dum clamat, patulo excipiens transmisit hiatu.’

625. quis e scissis, Crit. App. perruperit. Cf. the simile in
Ov. Met. 4. 121 sqq. ‘cruor emicat alte Ι non aliter quam cum uitiato
fistula plumbo Ι scinditur et tenues stridente foramine longe Ι eiaculatur
aquaS, atque ictibus aera rumpit?

626. hostis. H. well quotes Lucr. 4. ¹049 sqq. ‘namque omnes
plerumque cadunt in uolnus, et illam Ι emicat in partem sanguis, unde
icimur ictu; Ι et, si comminus est, hostem ruber occupat umor.’

sui refers to the real subject quis, not to cru0r3 so in other similar
cases, e.g. Prop. 3. 9. 56 ‘Antonique graues in sua fata manus.’

627. ut notum possit. This, as well as the next sentence, is quite
inconsistent with any idea that they would be rewarded for ‘ ling
relations, as inputet is explained by some in 325, see n. The ctions
mentioned here are concessions to the feeling which Caesar wou there
be made to outrage.

631. nullos hominum, no individuals in the throng. Th gen.
compels us to think of them separately. uacamus ‘have space,’ cf.
11 118 sq. ‘cui funera uolgi Ι flere uacet? '
