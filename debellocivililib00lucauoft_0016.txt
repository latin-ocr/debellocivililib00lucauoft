XIV HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

ἓ 3. Other authorities.

The only contemporary account of the battle'is that in
Caesar's de bello cz‘uz'lz'l. This has to be supplemented by the
accounts of Plutarch (Lz‘ves of Caesar and Pompeius), Florus,-
Appian3 and brief notices in the epitome of Livy, Velleius
PaterculuS, Suetonius, Eutropius, Orosius and the military
writers Polyaenus and F rontinus2.

In the following narrative I follow Caesar in the main3 but
1 have added from other authorities everything that there seems
no ground to disbelieve.

g 4. Historical sketch. Dyrrhachium to Pharsalia.

After the double disaster which in May, 48 B.c.³‚ Caesar had
brought upon himself by his audacious attempt to blockade a
superior with an inferior force, his position round Dyrrhachium
was untenable; and he at once decided to withdraw into the
interior. His route of march was across the river Genusus
through Asparagium to Apollonia, his first destination. His
retreat was rapid, and effected without loss; indeed the pursuing
Pompeians suffered severely in a cavalry engagement on the
banks of the Genusus. Leaving four cohorts to defend Apollonia
and three at Oricum to protect his wounded, while one was

¹ Caesar’s narrative appears to be quite trustworthy on the whole,
but it omits a number of details, which the writer perhaps did not think
important enough to record.

2 The account in Dio Cassius 41. 53—62 is entirely worthless. All
the distinctive features of the engagement are obliterated, and in lieu
the feelings of the combatants are described at tedious length in a
washy imitation of Thucydides.

3 Owing to the confusion in the Roman calendar and other causes
exact dates in our reekoning cannot be given. In Col. Stoffel’s con-

jectural system this date is May 26, and that of the battle of Pharsalia
June ²9·
