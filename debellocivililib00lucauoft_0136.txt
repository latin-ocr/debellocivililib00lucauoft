96 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII,

the weight of so many circumstances' which would agree well with
uertens if it could have a neuter sense ‘rocking’ (otherwise nutam· or
perhaps uergens which is said to be in some MSS might be read). In
505 Bentley proposed distulit and, unnecessarily, torquente, taking
diu with the main verb. abstinet ‘withholds' would perhaps be
better. sustulit ‘withstood‚’ which I also proposed, would do if we read
urgentis for ingentis. 509 laeuasque Bentley to make Lucan
agree with Caesar (but see diduxit cornua 506 and note there) aud
because saeuas ought not to be applied to Pompeians, but see 511.
521 frons z'bz' P. 522 tenet is most obscure. It cannot have
its usual sense ‘ keeps in position ' as that would contradict the next line
and it can hardly be interpreted as meaning ‘quas ad id ipsum tenebat!
A verb of moving appears to be required and ciet suggests itself: ciere
is used of moving reserves in Livy 9. 39. 8 ‘ ab ultimis deinde subsidiis
cietur miles.' The change is an easy one, and we have observed how often
Lucan’s vocabulary coincides with Livy's. 530 pubes EVU and
some editors. 532 secutast P originally, the better form, see on

130 above, secuta est the rest. 571 scelerum et BE some edd.
575 contundere all the MSS but V ; but this verb is not used
for cutting or thrusting. 584 Bentley, whose note should be read,

well supports his ingenious conjecture tot tantaque. But the Torquati
follow naturally on the Coruini, a name of similar origin. Lucan
mentions a Torquatus among the Pompeians in VI 285. 587 quid
Burman from a codex at Hamburg‚ and so Dr Hosius against his
MSS which all have quod. Mr Heitland prefers quod, understanding
‘how patriotic a weapon !' 589 Dr Hosius conjectures aetermcm,
comparing Virg. Aen. 6. 235. Lucan however alters virgil while
imitating him (Heitl. p. 110) and extremum seems rhetorically
more effective. 594 humani U and perhaps Gl. culmen G,
the later form for columen. premuntur VG, reguntur MBE and
U (but over an erasure), an easier reading. 598 commixta
plebe VlV which directly contradicts 577. 605 uoluentem V,. the

more common word 3 but uersantem is supported by Virg. Aen. 11. ⁷

669 ‘moriensque suo se in uulnere uersat.’ 616 mersere Oudendorp,
uertere MSS which Mr Heitland defends (Cl. Rev. IX p. 196),
pressere mb, Hosius, right in sense but not near enough to the
tradition. 622 anima U (rightly, see ad loc.), animae G¹, animam
the other MSS and Hosius who takes it with ictus (MUEl for ictu).
625 e scissis ed., emissis MSS which compels us to take uenis as
, ‘blood,' a use without example in Lucan or other Classical writers.
