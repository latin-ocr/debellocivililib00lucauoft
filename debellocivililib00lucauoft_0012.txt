to anticipate the Ides of Marchl. It need hardly be said that
the orations put in the mouths of Caesar, Pompey and others
are fictitious when it is known that even professed historians
would have been thought but poor masters of their art, if
they had recorded instead of inventing the speeches of their
characters2.

Secondly, Lucan's poem was written with an obJect, whose
nature he does not disguise from his readers, the glorification of
the cause which was lost at Pharsaliass. And he seldom loses
an opportunity of colouring and distortingeyents 1n the interests
of the optimates and their leader. The luxury of the Pompeians
is erased from the picture to make way for the rapacity of the

⁴ It is curious to note how Lucan has dealt with the incidents of the
scene of luxury in the Pompeian camp (see below, p. xxxi). The
turf on which the ‘ unspeakable' Caesarians sleep has been cut for the
