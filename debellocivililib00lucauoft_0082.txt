various meteoric appearances. Seneca, Nat. quaest. 7. 4. 4, says that
the trabs ‘praebet speciem ignis extenti' and ib. 5. 2 ‘trabes—non
transcurrunt nec praeteruolant ut faces sed commorantur et in eadem
caeli parte conlucent!

156. typhonas (Crit. App.). Lucan appears to reser to the fiery
phenomenon described by Pliny N. H. 2. 91, an awful appearance to the
peoples of Ethiopia and Egypt named after Typhon, a king of the
’ period, ‘ignea specie ac spirae modo intorta, uisu quoque toruo nec
stella uerius quarn tgneus nodus.’ Val. Fl. 3. 129 sqq. connects the
appearance with Typhon (that is Typhoeus) the giant imprisoned in
Aetna ‘arduus et late fumanti nube coruscus, Ι quantus ubi immenso
prospexit ab aethere Typhon Ι igne simul uentz'sque rubens quem
Juppiter alte Ι crinev tenet3 trepidant diro sub lumine puppes? The
last words throw light on Lucan’s somewhat obscure expression,
auidos...aquarum‚ the typhon being supposed to suck up the sea. A
writer in Cramer⁷s Aneca'. Vol. 3, p. 406 sq. says they are comets and
continues, in agreement with Pliny, that they are fiery globes, ὡσανεὶ
σύνδεσμοι πυρὸς and that they did not appear in Roman times but
terrified Egypt previously. Joh. Laurent. de mens. 4. 73, p. 274, writes
Τυφὼν πυρώδης καὶ αἱματώδης φαίνεται καὶ λεπτούς τινας διαρραίνων ,
πλοκαμούς (cf. crine in Val. Fl.). Aristotle de mundo e. 4 however has
τυφών in the sense of a thunderbolt without fire τὸ δ’ ἀστράψαν ἀναπυρωθὲν
βιαίως ἄχρι τῆς ’γῆς διεκθέον κεραυνὸς καλεῖται.-ἐὰν δ’ ἄπυρον ἦ
παντελῶς, τυφών. The interest in meteorology is a feature of Stoicism.

157. ingesto in the literal sense corresponding to the metaphorical
one of 785 n.

158 sq. cristas includes the apices or ridges in which the plumes
were set. solutis ‘ flooded the hilts with the molten blades’; cf.
Claud. VI Cons. Han. 344 sqq. ‘hic tabescente solutus Ι subsedit galea
liquefactaque fulgure cuspis Ι canduit et subitis fluxere vaporibus enses-³
But why the lcz'lts? Why were the swords drawn? In similar
circumstances Seneca Ν. Q. 2. 31. 1 speaks of the sheath ‘manente

uagina gladius ipse liquescit et inuiolato legno circa pila sermm omne
destillat.' erepta ‘ struck from their grasp.’

160. aetherem cf. aether, 154 n. nocens ‘deadly,' 60 n.

161. examine ‘swarm’ of bees is the only possible sense, as in
Virg. Ecl. 7. 13, Florus 4. 2. 45 (of this battle) ‘numquam inminentis
ruinae manifestiora prodigia, suga uictimarum, examina in sagmis,
interdiu tenebrae'3 Appian B. C. 2. 68 says, in disagreement with
