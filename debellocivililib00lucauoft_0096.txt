56 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VH.

353. fatis ‘by a natural death ’ 3 Virg. Aen. 4. 696 ‘quia nec sato
merita nec morte peribat ’ (and Henry’s note), or, as Ovid says, ‘ euntibus
ordine fatis ’ Her. 1. 101. potuere, as at N aples, 34 n. The vanity
is true to life3 cf. 378, 664.

355. uincere, i.e. ensure victory.

357. sponte without sua is poetical and Silver Latin. saera, if
really referring to imagine, will mean belonging to the ‘worshipped’ dead3
cf. Stat. Silu. 2. 7. 116 (of Lucan himself) ‘tu magna sacer et superbus
umbra.' Then antiquus must mean ‘ of the old school,’ ‘recalling
antiquity‚’ a term of praise, but it seems at least equally probable that
Lucan has inverted the epithets and that antiqua imagine ‘with
ancient marks’ of ancient lineage is intended, much as in 11 244 sq.
he writes ‘tu mente labantem Ι derige me, dubium certo tu robore flrma,'
when he would have done better to write labantem firma, dubium derige.
In this case compare for sacer 34²· sacra...imagz·ne is of course abl. of
description (241 n.). miles means they serve in the ranks, cf. 87 n.

3 58. reducem to be taken with all three names, which Lucan joins
again at V1 785 sqq. ‘ uidi Decios, natumque patremque Ι lustrales
bellis animas, flentemque Camillum Ι et Curios.’

359. uouentis, equivalent to a relative sentence or the Gk. part.
with the art„ a use much developed in Silver Latin, cf. Heitl. Introd.
p. 106, ‘currus ornante toga' 18 n. :quae ornat, pulsans 608=quaepul-
sabat. It occurs earlier, e.g. Hor. Carm. 1. 34. 7 diuidcns.

360. hinc starent. Cf. Hor. Carm. 3. 4. 58 ‘hinc auidus stetit
{Volcanus-⁹ primo Oriente. So ‘primis a Gadibus,’ IX 414. Either
point is ‘ first ‘ or ‘furthest ’ according to the way it is regarded.

362 sq. manus ‘bands ' as exciuere ‘called out' shows.

363. comprensum, Crit. App. limite, the zodiac being
regarded as the sun's path (cf. 867 n.)‚ Ov. Met. 2. 130 ‘sectus in
obliquo est lato curuamine limes.’

364. sub Noton ‘extending up to’ (so H. rightly); cf. x 48 ‘licet
usque sub Arcton Ι regnemus Zephyrique domos.’ The Greek ace.
Noton (also v 542, IX 539, 695, X 243) is not quoted from other
writers. hominum. For the partitive gen. cf. vlu 812 ‘quid-
quid in Euro Ι regnorum Boreaque iacet.' For sumus cf. 400.

365. superfusis, pouring beyond them, outflanking them, super
=‘beyond‚' as V111 164 ‘mundi Ι arva super nimios soles Austrumque
iacentis,’ and other places. The participle would mean more naturally
‘ pouring over them‚' as Livy 39. 49. 5 ‘iacentem hostes superfhsi
oppresserunt.' collectum, forced into a small space, ‘penned in'3
