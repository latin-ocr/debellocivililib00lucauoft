Seneca Cons. ad Marc. 25. 1 ‘paulum supra nos commoratus dum
expurgatur et inhaerentia uitia situmque omnem mortalis aeui excutit,
deinde ad excelsa sublatus inter filices currit animas? There they
remained till the general conflagration. The souls of the bad on the

other hand were punished in the nether world. So apparently Seneca
Ep. 117. 6, and other writers.
818 sq. refer to the bodies. fortunae. The gen. is a Graecism,
first in Horace (A.P. 212), and Virgil (Aen. 10. 154) ‘libera fati)
capit etc., cf. Lucr. 2. 999 sqq. ‘ cedit item retro, de terra quod
fuit ante, Ι in terras et quod missumst ex aetheris on’s, Ι id rursum
caeli rellatum templa receptant,’ cf. 5. 319 sq. ‘si procreat ex se Ι
omnia, quod quidam memorant, recipitque perempta' (i.e. caelum).
caelo tegitur. For the met. cf. Luer. 6. 1134 ‘caeli mutemus
amictum.'
· 82ο. inhumato funere ‘unburied corpses) The opposite is found
in Claudian in Rufin. 1. 155 ‘et condita funera traxi Ι carminibus
uictura meis‚’ cf. IX 151 ‘inhumatos condere manes.' For the sing. cf.
102 n. ς and for the abstract 471 n.

821. cladem, 651 n.

822. ¹⁵1-ane, here ‘drink'; cf. 1v 368 ‘subitarum tractus aquarum.'
utere, i.e. breathe.

823. aed ‘Nol’

827. Pholoen. Lucan clearly regards this as a mountain in
Thessaly or its neighbourhood; cf. 111 197 sqq. ‘linquitur Haemus Ι
Thracius et populum Pholoe mentita biformem. Ι deseritur Strymon,
tepido committere Nilo Ι Bistonias consuetus aues' (ef. 833), and VI
388 sqq. And so Statius Ach. 1. 168, 238 (where it is joined with
Tempe and Othrys)‚and also Τ lzeb. 3. 604, 10. 228 (where the reference
is to Thessalian horses), and Sidon. Apoll. 6. 23 ‘Pindus Othrys
Pholoe.' Ovid F. 2. 273 and Pliny N. H. 4. 21 name it as a mountain
in Arcadia, and so many Greek writers. It is however clearly placed
in Thessaly by Euripides Herc. Fur. 182, compared with 363 sqq„
Orph. Arg. 382, Dionysius in Anth. Pal. 6. 3. It would seem then
more than probable that there was a Pholoe in Thessaly as well as in
Arcadia, just as there was a river Peneus near both3 and that where
the fight of the Centaurs and Lapithae is referred to (as Val. Fl. 1. 140,
3. 66) the T hessalian Pholoe is intended. leones. In the time of
Pausanias lions existed in Thrace (6. 5. 4).

830. motum ‘disordered,’ ‘upset ’3 of the human body Livy 25.
26. 7 ‘nam tempore autumni et locis natura grauibus—intoleranda uis
