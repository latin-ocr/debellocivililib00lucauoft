32 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. V11.

3 sq. πίνει θάλασσα δ’ αὔρας Ι ὁ δ’ ἥλιος θάλασσαν Ι τὸν δ’ ἥλιον σελήνη.
According to Lucan on this occasion he desired not to seed but to
cloud his rays.

6. purus, adj. because referring to the sun’s state, Ν. L. P. 159.

orbe ‘’realm of a part of the world. So 22 3

9. Pompey‘s theatre completed in 52 Β. c. and known as the
‘stone theatre’ could hold 40,000 spectators. Lucan, who is well
aware of Pompey’s vain passion for popularity (cf. 726), says pointedly
1 132 sq. ‘totus popularibus auris Ι impelli plausuque sui gaudere
theatri?

10. innumeram, a ‘transferred epithet ’ belonging in sense to
plebis. effigiem properly a ‘ cast ’ or ‘ model’ (ef-fingo), then the
‘ copy ' as opposed to the real thing and so, as here, a ‘ phantom.’

12. Apparently an imitation of virgil Georg. 2. 508 sqq.

14. prim, an anachronism. His first triumph was in Sept. 81
after he reduced Numidia. The Spanish triumph was 10 years later,
followed in 10 years again by the last of the three (685), the Mithridatio.

16. fugax ‘runaway’ Sertorius, in allusion to his guerilla
methods of warfare. inpulit ‘set in motion‚’ ‘stirred up'3 cf.
11 549 ⁴ quique feros mouit Sertorius exul Hiberos ' and 718 sq.

17. Vespere, the lands of evening‚ the West‚ here Spain, cf. Sil.
It. 3. 3²5 sq. ‘totus adest Vesper populique reposti; Ι Cantaber ante
omnis.’ pacato ‘ tranquillized,’ i.e. ‘subjected‚’ a euphemism
apparently introduced by Julius Caesar and adopted in official language.
The British chieftain Calgacus says bitterly of the Romans ‘ubi
solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant ’ Tac. Agr. 30. pura ⁴ plain,'
opposed to the purple-bordered toga (praetexta) of magistrates and the
embroidered toga picta worn at triumphs and referred to in the next
line. Both at his first and his second triumph Pompey was strictly a
priuatus, as he had held no civil office but was simply general, with the
titles of propraetor and proconsul on the two occasions respectively.

18. quam, cf. V 152, so aster most words expressing comparison in

Plautus, Livy ete., but Cicero and Caesar would use ac. currus,
the triumphal car; so 280, Prop. 2. 14. 24, JuV. 8. 3 ‘stantes in
curribus Aemilianos.' The plur. is generic ‘ a triumphal car.’ or-

nante, i-e. quae ornat 3 59 n.

19. seu ‘whether it was that‚’ introducing three alternative
⁴ explanations, cf. 197 n. fine bonorum ‘at the close of his
happiness,’ compare VI11 29 ‘nisi summa dies cum fine bonorum Ι ad·
suit ' (again of Pompey).
