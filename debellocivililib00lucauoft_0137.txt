cRrrICAL APPENDIX. 97

abscindo, rescindo, interscindo are all used of opening veins‚ and the
emendation is supported by the passage of Ovid quoted ad loc. which
Lucan appears to have in mind : ‘transmittant' in the previous line may
have induced the corruption. 641 Hosius reads uincimur with
V, and seruiat with MBEV. But see Mr Heitland (Cl. Rev. 1x
p. 197). quae seruiat ‘to be slaves' may however possibly be
right. 643 pauidi EUG several edd„ but the adv. is clearly right.
⁸58 uoluit ed. with MSS, volvit the vulgate. We have here a
good example of the consequences of neglecting to spell Latin as the
Romans spelt it. The MSS, except V which gives uouit, have
uoluit which may corne either from uelle or uoluere. The edd. write
volvit, thus unconsciously alter-ing the text. Naturally dissatisfied with
this, they propose conjectures, e.g. fhvit, movit. nouit, a variant in V,
is better than either; but no change is needed. 659 iam BE, ait
the rest (G over an erasure) and edd„ *but the verb can be dispensed
with, IX 122 sqq. 675 seu Sulpitius‚ sed the MSS, a very natural
mistake3 but seu not only agrees better with Lucan’s custom elsewhere
but also with the preceding aut. 693 pugnae ed„ pugnae, the vulgate
punctuation, which makes the passage somewhat incoherent. As
already said (cf. 72, 121 and notes) Lucanis fond of making one noun
in the nom. the predicate to another. With nomen populare erit
means ‘will be due to‚' but with par ‘will consist in.' 696 erit
M perh. E, erum the rest. Both are correct, but erit is clearer.
¹18³ aut Marte subactis must be corrupt, as -it can only mean
‘or the conquered' as in 613, vlu 144. Bentley conjectured in
M. subactis, ‘ regarding the conquered,' :and a Marte peracto has
also been suggested. subactis may have come from peractis, in
which oese I would read ac for aut with V. peragere properly
is ‘to drive through' or ‘about,' so ‘to exhaust,' cf. Sen. Ep. 58. 2
‘pecora peragentem et totis saltibus dissipantem asilum‚' Ov- F. 4. 693
sq. ‘ ille suam peragebat humum, siue usus aratri Ι seu curuae falcis siue
bidentis erat,’ i.e. exercebat. So in Manil. 4. 593 ‘solem—peractum’
(Ellis, MSS ‘profectum ’). 740 cunctis is very suspicions. Heins.
conjectured fuluis. rutilis would give the same sense and be somewhat
nearer to the MSS. ⁷46³! Here again the MSS (and editors with
them) disagree sundamentfflly, and the passage appears to have been
tampered with. BE read nec plura locutus, MC sic milite iusso and
omit 747. But two MSS give intermediate readings, U having nec
plura locutus but omitting 747, G sic milite iusso'but retaining it.
These divergencies are intelligible‚ if originally the two readings of 746
