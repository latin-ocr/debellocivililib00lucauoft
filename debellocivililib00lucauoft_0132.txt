92 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. VII.

both appropriate words. Retaining both and ejecting cunctas, we have
an unexceptionable text which will explain the variants. ululare (179)
and uolitare (180) occurred in the same place of the line so that their
transposition was easy. When this took place the que was omitted for
the scansion. This gives VU’s reading. In the other MSS ululare
was corrupted to uolitare and then omitted as superfluous and un-
metrical (in M without this excuse) and cunctas added to make a linel.
The sense will be then ‘ they seemed to hear their fathers shriek like
spirits of the dead and to see their bloody wraiths flit before their eyes.'
sanguinis: ‘ sanguineas,' cf. 773 n.; it explains why the appearance was
an omen scelerum. They hoped to slay their parents. Compare Homer
Od. 20. 351 sqq. which Lucan is adapting: ἆ δειλοί, τί κακὸν τόδε πάσ-
χετε-ς νυκτὶ μὲν ὑμέων Ι εἰλύαται κεφαλαί τε πρόσωπά τε νέρθε τε vastus}
οἰμωγὴ δὲ δέδηε, δεδάκρυνται δὲ παρειαί, 1 αἵματι δ’ ἐρράδαται τοῖχοι
καλαί τε μεσόδμαι· Ι εἰδώλων δὲ πλέον πρόθυρον πλείη δὲ καὶ αὖλὴΙ
ἱεμένων ἔρεβὸσδε ὑπὸ ζόφον · ἠέλιος δὲ Ι οὐρανοῦ ἐξαπόλωλε, κακὴ δ’
ἐπιδέδρομεν ἀχλύς. 180 dementibus, ed. for sed mentibus MSS in
which neither sed nor mentibus appear to have any sense. For demens
in a similar connexion, cf. Prop. 3. 8. 15 ‘seu timidam crebro dementia
somnia terrent.’ The s of suos was written twice and d and e trans-
posed. 199 lumen (a common corruption of numen) V1UG some

edd. 200 omitted by MBEl. 202 cuncta is superfluous and may
have come from 201. caeca would furnish an excellent antithesis to
spectari. 216 Ι have changed the punctuation, placing a comma after
certo, instead of after campis. 225 habenis BE. Cf. Sil. It. quoted
ad loc. 244 et added by Grotius. The asyndeton in the MSS is
without justification. fatis VU1 Hosius; but see the parallels cited‘ad
” loc. 252 The MSS here are divided between arcessite and accersite.
These two originally distinct verbs (Dr Wilkins Journal of Philology
VI p. 278, Nettleship Contributz'ons to Latin Lexz'cogv‘aplzy s. vv.) appear
to be inextricably confused in MSS. 257 sq. only in G and mvbe‚
apparently an addition by someone who desired in Caesar’s speech

something corresponding to vv. 345 sq. in Pompey’s. Caesar does not ’

appeal to selfish motives till 264 sqq. 262 The MSS are thus
divided here: gladioque G (also C), gladiisque VU, gladiosque M, B
omits the word perhaps as illegible; for culpam VG (culpas U) ΜΒ
have culpa. gladiis (and culpas) may be dismissed as accommodations
to the plural exsoluite. They seem however to presuppose gladio—

1 This was written before Ι found practically the same reading and explanation in
Oud.'s note.
