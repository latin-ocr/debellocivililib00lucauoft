THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xxi

self was not spared: his inaction was vehemently attacked and
his vanity openly derided. How long was this Agamemnon, this
‘king of kings’l, to drag his vassal princes and a submissive
senate at his heels? Procrastination now was not prudence 3 it
was mere eowzudice, lust of authority, or worse. If the general
would not fight, the soldiers would. Weary of clamour and
apprehensive of the consequences of further delay, Pompey
summoned a council of war, announced that he would offer battle
on the morrow, and unfolded his plan2. It was simplicity itself.
Before the infantry closed, before a single missile had been
discharged on the enemy, the cavalry were to be precipitated

upon their unguarded flank, and Caesar's army would be routed.
‘I have communicated this plan,' he said, ‘to our cavalry and

they have agreed to carry it out³.’ He was followed by Labienus,
once Caesar's most trusted officer in the Gallie campaigns, who
declared that Caesar's soldiers were not the formidable victors
of Gaul and Germany, nearly all of whom had perished in battle
or by disease, but recent levies from Gallia Citerior‚ and, for the
most part, from the colonies beyond the PaduS. He concluded
by taking an oath that he would not return to the camp until the
victory was won and bidding the rest do likewise. Pompey
applauded and swore the same, as did all the other leaders
present. The sequel will show how these oaths were kept.

¹ So L. Domitius called him. Plutarch Pomp. 67, Caes. 41, Appian „oe
c. 67. The stupid Di 10 took ‘Agamemnon' to be a compliment (4²· 5). Ki ς’

² Plutarch Pomp. 68 represents this council as taking place the day
before the battle3 Caesar c. 86. 1 has the indefinite expression,‘ superio-
ribus diebus‚’ ‘on a previous day,’ which however must be interpreted by

the light of ‘in posterum diem’ in ἓ 5, so that there is no contradiction
between Caesar and Plutarch, as Col. Stoffel imagines, vol. 11. p. 240.

³ ‘Persuasi equitibus nostris idque mihi facturos confirmauerunt ut,
cum propius sit accessum, dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto

adgrederentur et circumuenta acie prius perturbatum exercitum pellerent
quam a nobis telum in hostem iaceretur? Caes. c. 86. Incident and

expres—sion (persuasz) alike throw a vivid leeakness of ,,
