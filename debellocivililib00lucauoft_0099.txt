appearing in the midst of a catalogue of places belonging to the
Latin League. Lucan however appears to be making a list of deserted
cities in the neighbourhood of Rome. Veii’s desolation is mentioned by
Propertius 4 (5). 10. 29 sq. ‘nunc intra muros pastoris bucina lenti Ι cantat,
et in uestris ossibus arua metunt.' coram, now Cori 3 cf. the
enumeration in Virg. Aen. 6. 776 sq. ‘Pometios castrumque Inuri
Bolamque Coramque z Ι haec tunc nomina erunt, nunc sunt sine nomine
terrae-³

393 sq. See Crit. App. uix with poterunt.

395. uacuum, i.e. cultoribus, cf. 399. The depopulation of Italy
is referred to again in 1 14—32‚ and assigned to the same cause. It is
a constant theme of complaint in Roman writers. quod, Crit. App.

coacta ‘forced upon him’; cf. Ov. Tr. 4. ιο. 35 ‘claui men-
sura coacta est,' and deditio coacta: in these cases the verbal makes the
transference easier.

396. Numam. The institution of the feriae Latinae (cf. I 550,
v 402) is ascribed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus to Tarquinius
Superbus (4. 49. 2); but, as H. says, citing Plutarch Num. 14, Numa
was regarded by the Romans as the founder of such ceremonies in
general. senator. Lucan’s language implies that the Senate‚ as
well as the two Consuls, were obliged to be present.

397. monimenta. rerum, properly ‘reminders of events,’ and so
‘meniorials of past greatness) Somewhat differently in VIII 807
‘ adde actus tantos monimentaque maxima rerum‚' of the marks left in
history.

398. crimen ‘ in these desolate cities we see our civil guilt.’

400. humani. See I 511sq. ‘urbem populis uictisque frequentem}
gentibus et generis, coeat si turba, capacem Ι hamam? where we have a
different exaggeration. He draws no clear distinction between Romans
and non-Romans, cf. 844 Latiae—turbae which is not limited to
Romans. For the reason see 54² sq.

402. uincto fossore ‘chained gangs of slaves’; cf. F lor. 3. I. 9
‘catenatos cultores.‘ For the abl. see ²03 n. and sor the sing. 102 n.

404. in nullos ‘on the heads of none.’ This, ordinarily a miti-
gaston, is twisted by Lucan into an aggravation of ,the mishap.

unquentum ‘peopled,’ apparently contrasted with repletam
‘replenished.’
405. faece. So Juv. 3. 61 cited by H. ‘quota portio faecis Achaei !'

similarly Piso is quoted by Tacitus as calling Athens a colluuies
nationum.
