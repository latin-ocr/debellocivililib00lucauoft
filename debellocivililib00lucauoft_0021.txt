THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xix

These indeed did not require the tokens which to pious or de-
sponding spirits conveyed the menace of divine displeasure. A
violent storm opposed the passage of the army into Thessaly.
Day was suddenly turned into night, fire flashed in their faces,
and tear-drop5‚ as it seemed, trickled down the still republican
eaglesl. Upon one of the ensigns a swarm of bees settled, and
its bearer could hardly lift from the ground the overpowering
weightss.

Seven days after the sack of Gomphi Qaesagmoving‘eastward
entered the Pharsalian -p-l-a-i—rb and encamping in a suitable

position awaited the Pompeian advance3. The ripening corn
promised him abundant supplies3 and his troops were in the
highest spirits and condition, all eagerness to face the foe and
wipe out the shameful memory of Dyrrhachium4. Accordingly
when his antagonist, about a week later, marching southward
from Larisa took up a strong position on the hills to the north or

having stayed behind ill at Dyrrhachium, · see Plutarch Cic. 39 init„
compared with Cato min. 55 and Cic. ad Att. 11 5. 3, and Cicero
himself dc Diu. 1. 68, 69. Lucan’ s statement that he was the mouth-
piece of the demand for battle is a rhetorical violation of histo ,γ
without a particle of jfi3QQ0n2 unless we draw it from the words of
the periocha of Livy, ‘.Cn Pomp-eihs ad Dyrrhachium obsessus a Caesare
et, praesidiis eius cum magna clade diuersae partis expugnatis, obsidione
liberatus, translato in Thessaliam bello, apud Pharsaliam acie uictus
est. Cicero in castris remansit, uir nihil minus quam ad bella natus,’
but castris there means the camp near Dyrrhachium, as it is clear from
Cicero’s own phrase (Diu. 1. 68) he was not in Dyrrhachium itself.
These last words on Cicero’s peace· -loving disposition come at least
in substance from Livy; and it isrworth noting how Lucan twists the
same sentiment to hi—s—oQ purpose (65 S-Q)

¹ See 154177, 163⁴ rorantia fletu Ι usque ad Thessaliam Romana et

publica signa' and notes. It is not difficult to conjecture the con-
nexion between these three phenomena.

⁸ Appian 2. c. 64. Caesar 1. c. on 98 note.

⁴ According to Plutarch, Caesar 43, to Caesar’s question, would they
wait sor reinforcements? they replied emphatically ⁴ N o.’
