NorES. 3 5

53, 54. orbis indulgens regno ‘indulging too far in sovereignty
over the world,’ i.e. prolonging it unduly. A bolder use occurs in
lv 664 ‘indulsit castris,' i-e. spread out his quarters.

55. lune habere sui ‘keep under his own control.’ For the gen.
compare 1 51 sq. ‘iurisque tui Natura relinquet! quis deus esse uelis.’

timeret because he would then lose his command.

57. bella trahi, cf. Introd. p. xviii. The subject of teneri, being
the same as that of queruntur, a verb of ‘saying‚’ is not expressed.
This happens sometimes even in prose, R. 1346, N. L. P. 377 (3).

58. uertere cuncta ‘when bent on universal overthrow.’ ΤῙιε
expression is proverbia13 cf. Cic. Off 1. ἓ 84- ‘Callicratidas—cum
Lacedaemoniorum dux fuisset Peloponnesiaco bello multaque fecisset
egregie uerlit ad extremum omnia!

59. erroribus ‘mistakes’ of judgment. crimen ‘guilt' ex-
plained by the next line, cf. [Ov.] Heroid. 17. 47 sq. ‘nec ullus Ι error,
qui facti crimen obumbret, erit.''

60. irruimus ‘ rush into ⁹ ; here and in Claud‘i'an Cous. Mall. Theod.
194· ‘irruet intrepidus flammis,’ with dat. apparently on the analogy of
incido. nocitura. In many places Lucan· employs nocere in a strong
sense, ‘be fatal ' or ‘ destructive '⁴3 cf. 160, 502», 69²·

61. uotum est ΜΞΝ-83118. ‘men pray sor-Pharsalial'3 cf. also 121 n.

62. auctor ‘model’3 ‘Caecilius malus auctor Latinitatis' Cic.
Att. 3. 7. 10.

63. Tullius. On this misrepresentation of the facts and of the
character of Cicero see the Introduction p. xviii, n. 4. iure togaque
=‘iure togato,’ and so the Schol. on Juv. 8. 243 quotes the line; but
the hendiadys is better, as Lucan alludes to Cicero's famous phrase
‘cedant arma togae-'3 see Cic. Plcil. 2. §zo-A

65. pertulit, sc. ad Pompeium.

66. passus ‘having had to bear silence for so long in the camp.'
Perhaps Lucan is thinking of the end of Cicero’s hexameter (cited
above) ‘ concedat laurea linguae)

69. Fortuna, for Pompey’s fortune cf. 75, 248, 601, 649, 705.

70. mundo, hyperbolical sor the foreign auxiliaries, cf. Introd.
p. xvii.

71. adfusi ‘stretched at your seet.' fusus means no more than
‘lying at length on the ground ’ς cf. 305, 652 corpora susa.

72. human-i generis with bellum. The dat. (Crit. App.) would be
more usual; the gen. is an extension of the possessive use such as we
have in Pompei ιη. bollum ‘cause of war’ to mankind. The Latin.
