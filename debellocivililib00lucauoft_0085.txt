190. ignorat caum, an early instance of ‘ telepathy’; conversely V
Claudian Epithal. Hon. 186 sq. ‘laetitiae causas ignorat dicere miles Ι
laetaturque tamen ' (at Honorius’ nuptials).

¹9²· uera fides (726) ‘ if we may really trust the story! augur.
His name was Cornelius, Gellius noct. Att. 15. 18. Iulius Obsequens
in his book on prodigies c. 125 fin. ‘ C. Cornelius augur Patauii
eo die cum aues admitterent proclamauit rem geri et uincere Caesarem.
Plutarch Caesar 47, who tells us the story was in Livy, gives his words
as καὶ δὴ περαίνεται τὸ χρῆμα. καὶ συνίασιν εἰς ἔργον ol ἄνδρες. νικᾶς, ὦ
Καῖσαρ. Comparing these accounts with Lucan we may perhaps
restore the augur’s words as res geritur,- homines concurrunt; uineis,

sar.
cae193. Aponus, the celebrated hot spring described by Claudian in

carm. min. 26. -

194. Antenora ‘of Antenor’ the founder of Patauium3 cf. Virg.
Aen. ι. 242 sqq. ‘Antenor potuit mediis elapsus Achiuis Ι Illyricos

T imauist dispergitur, i.e. ‘per ora nouem’ Virg. l.c.

195 sq. It is interesting to watch how Lucan works up his material
(above 192 n.). uenit summa. dies is taken from Virgil Aen. 2. 324,
maxima is added superfluously, and the second statement expanded
by epithet and paraphrase.

197. seu, introducing Lucan’s usual alternatives, cf. 19, 324, 674.

198 sq. appear to refer to such phenomena as foretold the defeat
of Varus according to Manilius 1. 901 sq. ‘arserunt toto passim
minitantia mundo (the sky) Ι lumina et ipsa tulit bellum Natura per
ignes Ι opposuitque suas uires (cf. ‘discordi,’ ‘obsistere ’) finemque
minata est! A portent of similar effect is recorded by Pliny in
reference to the Cimbric War, N. H. 2. 148 ‘ spectata arma caelestia ab
ortu occasuque inter se concurrentia pulsis quae ab occasu erant.'

mentm might be abl. but appears to be dat.; if so, aethere
and eaelo will denote the two warring halves of the sky. obs1stere
is perhaps technical‚ cf. 153 n. polos, the poles as well as all the
rest of the sky. numen (Crit. App.) :deus.
