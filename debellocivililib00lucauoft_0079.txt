NOTES. 39

aerium niuei montis liquere cacumen' 3 Hor. Serm. 1. 3. 9sqq. ‘saepe
uelut qui Ι currebat fugiens hostem, persaepe uelut qui 1 Iunonis sacra
ferret.' So in Pind. Nem. 8. 40 sqq. αὔξεται δ’ ἀρετὰ χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις ὡς
ὅτε δένδρεον *docet Ι ἐν σοφοῖς ἀνδρῶν ἀερθεΐσ’ ἐν δικαίοις τε Ι πρὸς
ὑγρὸν αἰθέρα. The last words belong to the tree, just as, in ib. 6.
64 sq. δελφῖνί κεν τάχος δι’ ἅλμας Ι ἰσώσαιμι (so we should read, ἴσον
εἴποιμι codd.) Μελησίαν, δι’ ἅλμας belongs only to the dolphin.

126. eat regimen, i.e. lets the winds steer. ignauum
‘inactive’ expl. by aste relicta. ‘abandoning his craft’ ·or ‘professi0n‚’
here the ars gubernandi (Cic.‚ Quintil.) or navigation. So iners
is properly a man who has no profession.

127. omn, he is mere ‘sreight'3 onus (cf. oner0,-oneraria) is a
regular word for ⁶ cargo.'

128. anim truces ‘even bold spirits‚’ animus the heart’s action,
cf. 1v 285 sqq. ‘saucia maiores animos ut pectora gestant 1 dum dolor est
ictusque recens’ (cf. 290), i.e. ‘there is more .vita1ity in the heart.' It
could hardly mean the hearts themselves. For the strong emphasis on
truces· cf. notes on 241, 280, 711, 760. pulsant. Cf. ll. 2. 716
θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι πάτασσε.

129. incertis ‘irregular,’ a bad sign. H. quotes Aesch. Ag. 99 5-

99⁷·13o. morus. The Schol. quotes pallida morte futura Virg. Aen.

4. 644 and the idea is common elsewhere. Cf. Macaulay, Hz'st. of
England ch. v, on Monmouth before Sedgmoor ‘The very children who
pressed to see him pass observed and long remembered that his look
was sad and full of evil augury.' The last words mean ‘their appearance
is that of doomed men.’ > On nentur-aest see Crit. App.

132. conderet ‘ stablish‚’ i. e. determine ‘ destiny’ as in Virg. Aen.
ιο. 35 ‘noua condere fata,’ Val. Fl. 1. 531 ‘uetera haec nobis et condita
pergunt Ι ordine cuncta suo.' The imperfect in sequence is due to
paam est being a historical present and so able to take the con-
struction of its sense (past) as well as of its tense (present), see N. L. P.
229, 389 (b), cf. 464, 638. quaeri with illo Marte ‘ the issue to be
determined is,’ cf. Livy 2. 57. 3 ⁴ magis quorum in manu sit (res
publica) quam ut incolumis sit quaeri! For the order cf. 33 n.

quid esset ‘ what it is to be,' i.e. whether a regnum or a libera
ciuitas. The imperf. indicates a time future to that of conderet. The
· ambiguity is usually avoided in prose by using the periphrastic future
‘quid sutura esset’ (N. L. P. †232); but not always, cf. Livy 2. 55. 9,
‘incerti quatenus Volero exerceret uictoriam,’ and other places.
