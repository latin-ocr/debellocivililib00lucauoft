THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. XV

detached to occupy Lissus, he proceeded up the valley of the
Aous past Jodnnz‘na to the pass of Me'tzovo and arrived at
Aeginium (Stagzis) in north-west Thessaly where he was joined
some seven days later by his lieutenant‚ Domitius Caluinus1‚
with the army which had been operating against Scipi02 in
Eastern Macedonia. The country was hostile ; for the news of
Dyrrhachium had spread like wildfire3 and Gomphi, which was
the first town of Thessaly they reached, and which a few
months before had placed all its resources at Caesar’s disposal,
closed its gates against him. It was promptly stormed and
abandoned to pillage. There were large stores of wine and
provisions in the place, and the soldiery recouped themselves
for the privations of the march by a drunken carouse, in which
the German troops were the most distinguishedss. From Gomphi
Caesar proceeded to Metropolis (now Paleokastro), which also
had meditated resistance; but the account which Caesar’s pri-
soners gave of the fall of Gomphi speedily opened its walls.
No harm was done to the inhabitants. Other towns accordingly
followed its example, and with the exception of Larisa and its
immediate neighbourhood4, Caesar was master of Thessaly.

Meanwhile Pompey² who had ceased to gursue Caesar after
his arrival in Apollonia, marched through Candauia by the Via
Egnatia into Macedonia, while Scipio after the retirement of
Domitius southward, crossed the Cambunian mountains to
Larisa. ,Rompey followed him and j0ined him not long after
the arrival of Caesar in Thessaly. ὲ

In the two armies thus united both generals held equal and

 

¹ Gnaeus Domitius Caluinus, not to be confused with L. Domitius
Ahenobarbus, the Pompeian leader.

² Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, proconsul of Syria, the father of
Cornelia, the last wife of Pompey.
