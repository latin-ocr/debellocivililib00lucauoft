NOTES. 49

241. exig-uo tractu ‘of even scant duration‚’ the abl. of description
(cf. 356), rare in Lucan ·aecording to Heitl. Introd. p. civ. For the
emphasis cf. 128 11.

242. damnare nefas, so v 471. discrimina, 109 n.

244. et fati, Crit. App. Comp. 1v 393 ‘mundi nutante ruina‚'
504 n.

245. paulum=paulispem e.g. Virg. Aen. 9. 296 ‘paulum aspectu
conterritus haesit)

246. spondero. We need not suppose that spondere, to warram*
or mgage, is here used for believing firmly. Caesar's sanguine spirit
may be said with perfect appropriateness and more point to ‘warrant
him success'3 see also on 758. For the poetical inf. with audax, cf.
1 474, 560·

247. stetit in dubio, a variation on fuit in dubi0; cf. Lucr. 3.
836. tata. Their past history showed both unconquered.

248. mersa ‘sunken‚' ‘buried,’ opposed to prosilit, cf. Rutilius 1
-129 sq. ‘quae mergi nequeunt, nisu maiore resurgunt Ι exiliuntque
imis altius acta uadis,' from which it would appear that R. read ‘merses
profundo; pulchrior exilit ’ in Hor. Carm. 4. 4. 65.

249. molior, for the constr. cf. Virg. G. 1. 286 ‘nona fugae melior,’
Quint. 1. 3. 8 ‘acuendis puerorum ingeniis non inutiles lusus.'

250. r. fortuna m., explained by 253. Compare v 291 sqq„ to
which allusion appears to be made, ‘ingrato meritorum iudice uirtus Ι
nostra perit: quidquid gerimus, fortuna uocatur: Ι 1105 fatum sciat
esse suum.'

252. Cf. 1v 484 ‘accersas dum sata manu ’ (oi¹ a suicide). For the
form of the verb see Crit. App.

253. alt would be erit in a principal sentence. It corresponds in
present sequence to esset (132 n.) in past sequence.

254. The scene is described by Lucan 1 387 sq. ‘elatasque alte,
quaecunque ad bella uocaret, Ι promisere manus.’

256. remoue, esp. frequent of a victor’s return. Caesar’s triumph,
having been forbidden by the Senate, could not be celebrated until he
had won a decisive battle. triumphos, half personified; so bellum
in F lor. 2. 2. 17 ‘iamin Africam nauigabat bellum.'

257 sq. See Crit. App.

259. The evidence of destiny, viz. the event will decide which of
the two rivals has the juster cause (cf. 1 126 sqq. below). quis:
uter, as in 281.' The confusion of duality and plurality in pronouns
and pronominal adjectives begins in Classical and spreads in Silver
