NOTES. ’ 37

91. perstent, imperfect, because of accepisse which, as the perfect
proper, may take a secondary tense. Compare Q. Cicero 4. 13 ‘quae
subsidia haberes et habere posses exposui ' (though in Eng. we say ‘ I
have set out what aids you have and can have ’), and N. L. P. 229,
389 (a). The student should observe that the present testor has no
power to alter the sequence of the verbs depending on the perf. inf.

92. accepisse ‘have had *it imposed upon me’ as terms (cf. leges
accspere) are imposed on the conquered.

93. sta-re, cf. 111 381 ‘tum res immenso placuit statura labore!

labor is very common in connexion with bellum, no doubt from
the exceedingly toilsome character of Roman warfare; so even without
bellum Tib. 1. 1. 3 ‘quem labor assiduus uicino terreat hoste,’ Prop.
4 (5). 1. 139. sine caede to be taken with captruum as well as
'subactum

94. tradere, for punishment. Caesar knew <as well as Pompey
cf. vnl 10 sqq. ‘ seque memor fati tantae mercedis habere Ι credit adhuc
iugulum quantum pro Caesaris ipse Ι auolsa ceruice daret ') what was in
store for him if defeated (304 sqq.).

95. scelerum with furor ‘guilty madness.’ See also Crit. App.

96. metuunt. The Schol. notices the change of person as
intentional, cf. 109 n.

97. terras opposed to aequore. Pompey’s-ficet commanded the
soe. The Schol. quotes Virg. Aen. 9. 131sq. ‘rerum pars altera
adempta est3 Ι terra autem in manibus nostris.'

98. praemamas ‘unripe.' Caesar says of himself B. C. 3. 81
‘ idoneum locum in agris nactus quo prope iam matura erant frumenta'
that is a few days (ib. 82) before Pompey's arrival in Thessaly.

99 sq. The expression is somewhat redundant. We could dispense
either with uotum or ut manet.

100. glanna, i.e. non same 3 cf. ieiuna 98.

101. mein, i.e. meorum; perhaps a compendious comparison
(28 n.); but cf. 652 n. For the idea cf. 655.

102. his, neuter ‘ by the measures? ne, cf. 406 n. tiro,
sing. for plur. as 758 and 838 uictor, 402 jbssore, 203 augure and
mens, 294 corpus, 598 and 830 cadauer, 820 funere, 834 uolture, 837
alite. So probably Cyclops 150. Pompey takes just credit to himself
for training his raw levies; compare Introd. p. xviii.

103. irae, of martial ardour3 frequent in Lucan, e.g. 111 614 ‘creuit
in aduersis uirtus; plus nobilis irae Ι truncus habet,’ 1v 267, 553 ; 124,
386 inf.; Cic. Acad. 2. ξ 135 ‘ipsam iracundiam fhrtz'tudimk quasi
