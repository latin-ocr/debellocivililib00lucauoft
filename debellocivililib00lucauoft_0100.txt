406. 00 ne ‘to such a point of ruin that...not.’ So Mr Parry
takes the passage, which is generally misunderstood. The consecutive
sense of ne, which was developed out of the final sense, is extremely rare
unless a verb like ffcz'o precede (N. L. P. 393, 45 5) and the action
may be regarded as purposed as well as resulting. But see Tae. Ann.
14. 7 ‘at Neroni, nuntios patrati facinoris opperienti, adfertur euasisse
leui ictu sauciam et hactenus adito discrimine ne auctor dubitaretur.’
The use here however is stranger. corpore, Crit. App.

408. nomina, perhaps plur. because Cannae is plur., but see 77 5 n.

410 sq. signauit. The 18th of July was marked in the Calendar
as the dies Alliensis. It does not appear however that the date of
Cannae, Aug. md, was similarly marked. And the statement that Rome
‘chose to ignore’ (nescire) Pharsalia is untrue, as it is marked as a
victory in the Fasti Amiternini and the Fasti Antiates and was pro-
bably so marked in the Fasti A llifani.

411. pro tristia. fata, so in v 57, vl 305.

41²· tractu. For trahere of ‘inhaling’ cf. Ov. Met. 2. ⁵230
‘feruentisque auras, uelut e fornace profundo, Ι ore trahit? fluentis
‘spreading' of the imperceptible diffusion os plagae-seeds through the
air by the aura fluens (cf. vl11 247). H. well refers to V1 89, ‘traxit
iners caelum fluidae contagia pestis Ι obscuram in nubem’ with which
compare Lucr. 6. 922 sqq. and 1120.

413. insanam ‘maddening.’ Cf. Shakespeare Macheth 1 3 ‘the
insane herb that takes the reason prisoner '; H. cf. ‘ uaesana sames' Virg.
Aen. 9. 340. permissas ‘abandoned,’ ‘surrendered.’ v 694 sq.
‘ mundi iam summa tenentem Ι permisisse mari.' Cf. 731 n.

414. laturos. To see in the fut. part. a reference to the imaginary
supposition contained in ‘possent’ gives an insipid sense; and the

Qgp-art. in ppets often appears to differslittle from ‘’aptissfissmae e.g.
Enn. dub. 7 ‘carbasus alta uolat, pandam ductura carinam.' plena,
Crit. App.

415. explere, i.e. fill the gaps made by these disasters, 387 n.

417. explicat, cf. 201 n. eripiens ‘while snatching them
away.’ The sense is that differently expressed by Manilius 2. 8 ‘patriae

qui iura petenti, Ι dum dabat, eripuit)
419. quam magna cadas ‘what greatness falls with thee) ⁴ How

great thou art in tlzy fall ' hardly hits the meaning of the Latin. Scott
Marmz'on canto 11 st. 28 ‘ How false the charge, how true he fell, 1 This
guilty packet best can tell.'
