NOTES. 55

in ualeam they suit the action to the word, As however accipere is
more usual in this sense, some explain it of ‘taking the omens';
which a scholiast says the soldiers themselves did in transglutiendo (a
word of the camp ‘ while gulping down their rations ’) and hence ‘non
fuit opus arte ducis.' See also Crit. App. bem, 112 n.

333. The kernel of truth here has been pointed out on 330 n.
Lucan conceives of the Caesarians as troops of Stoic philosophers.

of Rome, they could not have rushed to battle more impetuously.
locasses, Crit. App.

337. ln rectum, and so there was to be a pitched battle; cf. x
436 sqq. ‘cum procul a muris acies non sparsa maniplis} nec uaga
conspicitur, sed iustos qualis ad hostes Ι recta fronte uenit.’

- 339. corde gelato, the opposite of 11 557 sq. ‘feruidus haec iterum
circa praecordia sanguis Ι incaluit,’ cf. Stat. Theb. 2. 544 ‘ sanguisque
in corda (so we should read) gelari.' gelo is a Silver Latin word.

340. tanto duci, with omen; cf. Crit. App.

341. prount, cf. 248.

342. sublimi, more common of the rider than the horse. prae-
uectus equo, in Virg. Aen. 7. 166 the phrase means ‘riding ahead‚'
here ‘ riding along’ so lx 1003 ‘ Asiam (the coast) praeuehitur.

344. effunfflto ‘put forth,' as in Livy ιο. 28. 6 ‘quantumcunque
uirium habuit certamine primo findi& Ov. Met. 1 278 ‘ uires eff‘undz'te
uestras Ι (sic opus est).’

346. tramis, 46 n.

347. qui follows quisquis as in 756. aeserta, which he has

quotes. For the sense cf. Virg. Aen. 12. 80 ‘illo quaeratur coniunx
Lauinia camp0.’

351. Caesar is to be the victim whose blood will ‘seal Rome’s
covenant,’ or the settlement which will follow on a Pompeian victory.
By putting this forecast in Pompey's mouth, Lucan intentionally suggests
the irony of fate, cf. lx 1021 ‘hoc (Pompey's) tecum (Caesar) percussum
est sanguine fhedus’ and x 371. For sancire cf. Livy 8. 7. 19 ‘cum aut

morte tua sancienda sint consulum imperia aut impunitate in perpetuum
abroganda)
