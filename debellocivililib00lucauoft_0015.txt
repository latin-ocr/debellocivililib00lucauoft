THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xiii

There appear good grounds for believing that one, and perhaps
the chief, of these was the now' lost history of Livy. More than
Ι one incident, of which Lucan is now the earliest witness, is
said to have been recorded in Livy, e.g. that of the Augur
Corneliusl. A predecessor of Lucan, Valerius Maximus, the
industrious collector of anecdotes‚ used Livy and refers to
him; and there are some striking agreements between Lucan
and Valerius Maximus2. A succeeding historian, L. Annaeus
Florus, drew chiefly from Livy33 and Lucan and Florus are
often in the closest agreement4. Lucan again must have

beennatmally drawn to *a writer whose tre-afflant Qf [he
Qmjsspmpelaffl Nor is it superfluous to

observe that the frequency with which Livy may be used for
the illustration of Lucan's phraseology points of itself to the
same conclusionss.

So far as I know, no evidence is forthcoming that Lucan did
actually draw from any other source. There 1s nothing to show
that he used the lost history of Asinius Pollio, and if within the

s.—

present book he made any use of the narrative of Caesar, it was

certainly only for the purpose of contradicting it.

Roman Literature, ed. 2, 5 348 notes 1 and 2.
⁴ It hasbeen sought to explain these agreements by the hypothesis
that Florus copied Lucan. That Florus had read the ‘ Civil War,’
that for ideas and expressions he is often indebted to its author, may
well be admitted. But to suppose that in questions of fact the epito-
mator of a history would abandon its statements for those of a poem Μ

. written more than a century after the events is an imputation of

incompetence not admissible without the strictest proof. The same
may be said of Appian.

⁵ Tac. Ann. 4. 34 ‘ T. Liuius—Cn. Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit
ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret.' Compare on the whole
question Mr Heitland, Introduction, p. 127.
