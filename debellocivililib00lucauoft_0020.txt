’ xviii HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

memorable day of Pentecost; and the words of the sacred writer¹
may be almost literally applied: “Parthians and Medes and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and
Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in
Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from
Rome, both Jews and proselyteS‚ Cretans and Arabians2.''

In point of numbers then Pompey had an immense superi-

ority3 but quite other was the fighting value of his vast array.
By· constant and careful drilling he had turned his raw recruits

 

into moderately well—trained soldiers33 but gligywere thhss
ygtemns ,of Caesar. As the sequel showed, he could count
indeed upon their fidelity; but he could not evoke their en-
thusiasm. His cavalry owed their superiority to numbers alone,
and his auxiliaries were little more than a useless incumbrance.
The successes of Dyrrhachium had inspired his troops with
confidence in their leader and themselves; but they had at the
same time released all the elements of disorder. The spirit of
the nobles, whether holding military command or serving as
volunteers in the camp, was almost beyond control. Confident
of victory and burning to return to the Capital, their impatience
of discipline was only equalled by their impatience of delay, and
the contempt which they felt for their opponents was rapidly ex-

tended to their leader. If Pompey’ 5 strength of character had
been one half of his military talem, or a quarter of his egotism,

 

'he would have been able to copem with the evil. As it waS, the

feebleness of the head and the unruliness of the members con-
stituted a situation which to the discerning was full of alarm4.

1 Acts ii. Lucan’s Caesar well sums them up in the contemptuous
phrase ‘mixtae dissona turbae barbaries' (272).

2 The grand total, though undoubtedly very large, is certainly wildly
exaggerated by Florus (2. 13. 44) 3oo‚000 ‘ praeter auxilia reges et
senatum? Appian c. 70 mentions that some put it at 4oo,ooo.

3 He had not spared himself in doing so. Plut. Pomp. 64. After
all his efforts the description of Cicero was still correct ‘ signa tirone et
collectz'tz'o exercitu cum legionibus robustissimis contulit ’ ad Fam. 7. 3. 2 ;
cf. Lucan 102.

4 Cicero was one of them. But he was no longer with the army,
