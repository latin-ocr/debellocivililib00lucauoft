1 7⁴2 ‘nec se Roma ferens’=et R. se nonferens) nor in <uu which he
defends by vm 672 sq. ‘nodosaque frangit Ι ossa diu? With uertens
however, which indicates an essentially momentary action, this adverb is

· not appropriate3 and a comparison of 111 337 sq. ‘ non pondera rerum,{

nec momenta sumus‚' suggests that rerum tot pondera. should refer to
what was of importance in deeiding the issues at stake. Some con·
jectures are given in the Crit. App.

505. nto torrente. The metaphor is apparently from a river in
flood. The sole difference between fortune and fate in this and other
places of Lucan appears to be that indicated by the capital letter. Cf.
88 sq., 205 sq., 111 392, v1>11 21 sqq.

506. Lucan apparently misled by the fact that there were a few
horse on the right wing (Frontinus quoted on 224) wrongly regards
both Pompeian wings as participating in the outflanking movement
which was to turn the battle. See Caesar's account c. 88 fin. ‘dextrum
cornu eius (Pompey) riuus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat: quain ob
caussam cunctum equitatum sagittarios funditoresque omnes in sinistro
cornu obiecerat! For diduxit cornua, ‘drew the wings in different
directions,’ compare Livy 28. 14. 15 and 17 ‘nuntium (Scipio) ad
,Silanum et Marcium misit ut cornu. extenderent in sinistram partem
'quemadmodum se tendentem ad dexteram uidissent.-ita diductis cor-

nibus' etc.

507. belli, cf.. 112, 651 n. ultima, Caesar's extreme right
and left.
508. sparsa, of the free order of light armed. per extremos

...man-{plum i-e. over Pompey‘s extreme left and right.

’ 509. insequitur, cf. Caesar c. 93 ‘ eodem tempore equites ab
sinistro Pompei cornu, ut erat imperatum, universi procucurrerunt omnis-
que multitudo sagittariorum se profudit, quorum impetum noster equi-
tatus non tulit, sed paullum loco motus cessit, equitesque Pompeiani hoc
acrius instare et se turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto

circumire coeperunt.’ saeuas ‘ bloodthirsty bands,' see Crit. App.
511. cuncus, dat. inde...1nde, cf. 2 30 sq.

512. faces. These, like the saxa, would be hurled from ballzzvtae, cf.
11 686 sq. ‘ tortaque per tenebras validis ballista lacertis Ι multg'fidas
iaculata faces.’ But it is not clear what they are doing here where there

are no ships or buildings to fire. It looks as if Virgil Aen. 1. 150 w&

‘iamque faces et saxa uolartt‚Qbeing copied without reflecti-Q, In
val. 1⁴⁸1. 3. 96 ‘ saxa facesque atras et tortae pondera sundae’ are the

weapons of a mob.
