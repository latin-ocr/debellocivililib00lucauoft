NOTEs. 47

3. 4. 103 ‘scuta sed et galeae quamuis radientur et auro.’ The act.
radio is a myth. ab, poetically inserted, R. 1213, N. L. P. 320. 1.

217 sqq. All our authorities (Caesar B. C. 3. 88, Plutarch Pomp.
69, Appian 2. 76) agree that Scipio commanded the Pompeian centre.
But they disagree about the wings. Plutarch says Pompey commanded
on the right but Appian Lentulus; they agree in placing Domitius on
the left. Appian says Pompey with Afranius τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐφύλαττεν,
which may be true of Afranius, but in the case of Pompey is un·
doubtedly an error, due perhaps to his early retirement to the camp.
Caesar does not expressly say who commanded the wings but notes
that Pompey was on the lest, ‘in eo loco erat ipse Pompeius.’ All
we can conclude with certainty is that Domitius commanded one wing‚
and Pompey—-in his absence, Lentulus—the other. Which these
were must be doubtful.

219. quarta is a mistake for ‘tertia’3 cf. Introd. p. xi, n. 4.
The first and third were the two legions with Pompey which had served
under Caesar in the Gallie wars. pugnax ‘ indomitable,’ Lucan's
epith. for Domitius, inf. 600 (which explains numine aduerso), 11 479.

221 sq. fortissima. Merivale Hist. qf tlze Romans under tlte
Empire (vol. 11 p. 270) says ‘ His troops were sor the most part sully
trained to war.' Cf. Introd. p. xvii. For Cilicum see Introd. p. xvi, n. 6.

223. sapio, Introd. p. xv. miles, 87 n. dux primus, in
the African war. There were other duces, e.g. Cato. orbe, 6 n.

224. stagna ‘the pools of the Enipeus’'overflow.' Compare the
language of Livy 1. 4. 4 ‘ super ripas Tiberis effusus lenibus stagnis nec
adiri usquam ad iusti cursum poterat amnz's’ and further on with slcci
226 ‘ cum fluitantem alueum quo expositi erant pueri tenuis in sicco aqua
destituisset.' This flood of the Enipeus is mentioned by the military
writer Frontinus Strat. 2. 3. 22 whose words confirm Lucan in other
respects ⁴ dextro latere sexcentos equites propter flumen Enipea quod et
alueo suo et alluuie regionem impedierat (cf. Caesar’s words 88 impeditis
ripis) reliquum equitatum in sinistro cornu cum auxiliis omnibus
locauit! It is quite consistent with the unsettled weather of which we
have other indications‚ 153 n. undantis ‘rising in waveS‚' cf.
Virg. G. 3. 28 ‘undantem bello magnumque fluentem Ι Nilum.’ F or
the Enipeus see the Introd. p. xxxvi.

225. cappadocum, mentioned in 111 244 among Pompey’s allies.
largus habenae (Crit. App.) ‘lavish of the rein‚' i.e. riding with
loose teins (‘effusa largus habena’ Sil. It. 7. 695). For the gen. ‘of
fulness’ (N. L. P. 147 (b), cf· R. 1336), cp. lx 608 ‘sons—largus aquae?
