88 LVCANI DE BELLO cIV1L1 ΠΒ. vn.

Philippos is reserved to the end. It of course means both Pharsalia
and Philippi.
From a comparison of Lucan’s language in book V11 and elsewhere
it would appear that he uses Pharsalia in Thessaly and Philippi in
Macedonia as though they were convertible terms. .0f Pharsalia,
besides the correct Thessalia Thessalicus (vn 6, 152, 164, 202, 302,
439, 454, 473, 650, 693, 765, 808, 847), we find used also Emathia,
Emathias (166, 191, 427, 683, 794, 799, 846, 860 of both Pharsalia and
Philippi), and Haemonia, Haemonius (825, 858 of both). Further,
Pharsalia is placed near Mount Haemus, the Balkan range (174, 480),
and Thrace (826, 8 3 3). Phihppi is said to be in Thessaly (591 sq.)‚ and
it is used of both the battles (872), which are said to take place on
the same ground (854). This confusion did not begin with Lucan.
Ovid clearly identifies the two in Met. 15. 823 sq. ‘Pharsalia sentiet
illum (Augustum) Ι Emathiaque iterum madefient caede Philippi! So
Manilius 1. 908—913 and probably Propertius 3 (4). 11. 35 and 40 (and
my praefatio p. vi), not to speak of later writers. The source of the
confusion has been sought by Merivale and others in a misunderstanding
of Virg. G. 1. 489 sqq. ‘ergo inter sese paribus concurrere telis Ι Ro-
manas acies iterum uidere th'lz'ppz'; Ι nec fuit indignum superis bis
sanguine nostro Ι Emathiam et latos Haemi pinguescere campos.’ It
certainly seems most improbable that Virgil should have been ignorant
that Philippi was nowhere near Pharsalia: iterum may be taken with
paribus concurrere telis, while in the following lines bis may be taken
as once in Emathia (Le. Thessaly) and once in the broad Haemus
plains (Macedonia) 3 or again, what seems preferable, these two expres-
sions together may be supposed to be the equivalent of the political
Macedonia which included Thessaly. Besides the ambiguity of this
passage, there were other circumstances which would contribute to
confusion. 'Emathia the old name of Macedonia or that of one of its
districts, appears also in Thessaly ([Hom.] Hymn. Ap. 216), of which
according to Servius on Virg. l.c. it was actually a name. Haemonia,
the old name of Thessaly, is applied by Apollonius Rhodius to a district
of Macedonia, and there was an Enipeus in Macedonia as well asin Thes-
saly. It may however be doubted whether the confusion is due to sheer
mistake. Rhetoric and flattery probably had a hand 1n its production.
Ι Qeffectiye was it to make the two great battles fought on the sa e

ground! How dexterous to suggest to a ruler who wished to bring his
¹2 οννηῗὸῑὶιιῃεε into the closest connexion with the career of his‘ parent’
that here too he followed him ‘perque pat-mis· pater Augustus uestigza '
Ι uicit2’ Manil. 1-c.
