THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xxix

dense mass of over six thousand projeeted itself upon the
thousand horsemen of Caesar. The weight of the attack

hostile cavalry, their first object accomplished‚ spread out in
looser formation, and rode in squadrons‚ to take the defenceless
legionaries in flank and rearl. The whole force of slingers
and bowmen followed them. T hat instant Caesar gave the
signal to his reserves; and six cohorts, with weapons levelled at
their enemies’ faces, furiously charged the advancing horsess.
The effect of this apparition was instantaneous. The horse-
men hardly waited to be attacked, but fled in ludicrous panic
to the tops of the adjacent hills. The light-armed troops were

Caesar’s clemency did not extend to foreigners.

cohorts having other work in hand. It is quite clear that Caesar's
famous order parce ciuibus (Florus l.c. on 319, Suet. Iul. 75 ‘acie
