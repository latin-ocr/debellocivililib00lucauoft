such line however appears to be wanted. 95 Bentley would punctuate

B¹Um‚ et mors uentura est MVGb‚ U has est at the end of 129. The
variants seem to be best explained by the text. uenturae and st,
the weak form of est, were written as one word in accordance with
the best classical usage; compare note on 53² below. For the words
Hosius well compares Juv. 4. 74 sq. ‘in quorum facie miserae magnaeque

which would mean ‘is set upright ' or ‘is elevated ’ (e.g. Livy 1. 27. 8).
For ‘corrigere’ cf. Seneca de ira 1. 6. 8 ‘hastilia detorta corrigamus‚'
‘curua corrigere’ Plin. Ep. 5. 21. 6 ‘to set the crooked straight,’
proverbial of a Utopian reformer. The corruption, which appears to
be due to the first letter of 1. 140, was detected by Nettleship who
proposed derigitur3 but ‘derigere’ seems to mean ‘to make some-
thing straight ' (ab initio), not ‘to straighten it.’ 143 aptat a variant
reading of v adopted by Grotius and Oudendorp, artat the Mss. It
is hard to see why the horsemen should draw the reins tight (for the
sense of which cf. [Tib.] Pan. Messal. 91 sq. ‘ aut quis equum celeremue
arto compescere freno Ι possit et effusas tardo permittere habenas')
before going into action, and several of our MSS have artare for apt. at
vul 655. Compare ‘aptare arma’ Livy 5. 49. 3 ‘make ready for
action.' 154 omitted by M1V1 and generally condemned as an interpo-
lation. oculis should be oculos. 156 pythonas BME, a mere corruption
of typhonas. 1⁷2 nimione Bersmann‚ nimione MSS. 179 sq. defunc-
tosque ululare patres et s. u. ed. after Oudendorp who reads defunctos
ululare3 most editors follow MBEG. The MSS disagree remark-
ably here. defunctosque patres et cunctas s. MBEG, defunctos uolitare
patres ets. VU; in 180 EGB have uolitare or the like, MVU ululare.
The suspicious word in these variants and in the vulgate text is cunctas,
which is extremely seeble in itself‚ and necessitates our giving to sanguinis
the sense of ‘ kindred ' which is without example, if we except a ,corrupt
passage in Phaedrus (Ι. 28. 10); Heinsius conjectured iuncti for it,
but this does not explain the other MS variants. On the other hand

defends inter alia by [Ovid] Ibis 157 ‘ante os oculosque uolabo' are
