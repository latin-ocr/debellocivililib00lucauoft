1. seg-mor, i.e. rising more tardily. Oceano. A preposition
would be added in prose, R. 1258, N. L. P. 149. The sun was slow
in obeying the call of destiny (εἱμαρμένη), the immutable chain of cause
aud effect which in the Stoic view governed the universe.

2. lumem with numquam mag-is ‘ never more fraught with
mourning.’ See also Crit. App. Titan, used only of the sun in
Lucan, except ix 654 where ‘Atlanta’ is added. contra, the sun
and planets being supposed to move in the opposite direction to that
in which the ether and the fixed stars revolved. Ovid Met. 2. 72 sq.
(of the sun) ‘nitor in aduersum nec me, qui cetera, uincit Ι impetuS, et

rapido contrarius euehor orbi,' so Manilius, the Stoic poet, 1. 258 sq.

⁶ ‘solemque—atque alia aduerso luctantia sidera mund0.’ contra is also
used of mounting up a fixed object (cs. ‘aduerso monte’ uphill) as H.
takes it here, comparing Plin. N. H. 7. ἓ 83, Silius Italicus 14. 352.

3. cursum (Crit. App.) with rapiente and retorsit.

5. attraxit ‘drew to himself! The Latin, having no middle
voice, often uses the active instead, without as well as with se3 so serre
means φέρειν ‘bring’ and φέρεσθαι ‘ take.’ pabula. The Stoics
and other ancients taught that the sun was fed on watery vapours. ⁹
Lucan 1 4¹ 5 sq. ‘ flammiger an Titan, ut alentes hauriat undas Ι erigat
Oceanum fluctusque ad sidera dum& So the false Anacreon 21 (¹9).
