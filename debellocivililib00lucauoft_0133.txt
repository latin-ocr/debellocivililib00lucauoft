CRITICAL APPENDIX. 93

culpam. We have then to decide between gladz‘o—-cuspam and gladios—
culpa. In the conflict of MS testimony internal considerations must

’ decide, and ‘ free your swords from guilt' as explained by l. 261

‘palmam—petzktz's’ is not so pertinent in the context as ‘ free yourselves
from guilt by your swords,' i.e. ‘pugnate truces' ; cf. vm 517 sq. ‘crimen
habemus Ι purgandum gladio' and elsewhere and for the verb exsoluite v
259 ‘metus exsoluerat audax Ι turba suos) On the other hand Hosius’
reading may be 'thought to derive some support from 263 ‘nulla
manus—pura est! 286 quorum M1G1V Hosius; but quarum BU
(also C) is a less obvious reading and agrees better with ensem—lancea—
lacerto. 303 parata MV Hosius; but paratur BEUG (and C) is
well explained by Mr Heitland ‘ what we are doing today means re-
ward or punishment according to the event' and is supported by 470.

MSS, which is abrupt, nec, an easy change, would continue the
command in 326. 331 For the not very satisfactory capiunt we may
conjecture rapiunt. 335 locasses Grotius, locasset the MSS absurdly;

sor Lucan would not have said ‘si Caesar in Marte locasset totidem
Caesaris’ (Magni soceros), and he has just told us Caesar did not

arrange his men. 340 timeri Heinsius perhaps rightly, though Virg.
Aen. 7. 173 sq. slightly favours the active. 351 uolunt MU, not so
idiomatioelly. 363 Mr Heitland rightly defends comprensum ‘en-
compassed’ against compressum, V and most edd., comparing lx 913
‘quasi ualli spatium comprendit harenas’ and observing that ‘pre-
meretur ' in 111 α 5 3 is not really parallel. 385 concurrunt G, Grotius;
but the actual engagement does not begin till 470. 394, 393 ed„
393, 394 MSS and edd. With the vulgate order the constr. is taken
to be ‘rus uacuum uix poterit monstrare Albanos Lares.' But ruins
are not specially characteristic of Gabii Veii and Cora nor desolate
country of Alba and Laurentum3 both belong to both. And, as the
que's indicate, 394 is part of the catalogue of cities. Probably the
verses would have been transposed before but sor the fact that a
reference to Alba follows. This however counts for nothing, as the last
town mentioned, Laurentum, is no nearer to Alba than either Gabii or
Cora. 895 quo MG (Ρ E1); but elsewhere in Lucan habito takes the
acc„ seemingly the proper case in this use ; cf. e.g. Horace Ep. 1. 14. ἰ
(agellum) ‘habitatum quinque focis.' 406 corpore BG, tempore (by a
common confusion) EVU1 (and M, but over an erasure) which suggests
that civil wars ended with Pharsalia. 40¹1 posset MU, which might stand.
