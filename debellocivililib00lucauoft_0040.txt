by the ‘praetorian,' or front gate, and left it for Larisa by the
‘ decuman,' or rear gate. The stream in question may have been
a small tributary of the EnipeuS‚ if we reject the view that it was
that river itself 1. The position would be further deterrnined if
we could with Leake identify the river below the height where
the Pompeians made their last stand, which was six miles from
the camp of Pompey, as the Onochonus (or Onchestus) not sar
from Scotussa2.

1 In any case the Enipeus was at no great distance, and would be
naturally mentioned in connexion with the battle.

2 Nothing can be inserted from the unexecuted intention of Caesar
to move on Scotussa‚ about 5²} miles due Ν. of M. Karadja Ahmet‚
which Plutarch Caes. 43 fin. records, nor from Lucan’s epithet aduerso
m v. 214.
