NOTES. 33

πο. anxia refers to ‘the dreaming thought’ (quies 22); cf. 815 n.

π. contraria uisis. That dreams ‘go by contraries' is the
common belief and the view which, according to Zonaras (ιο. 8),
· Pompey himself took of this dream, although the younger Pliny
advising his friend Suetonius (the biographer) says Ep. 1. 18. 2 (quoted
by H.) ⁴ refert tamen euentura soleas an contraria somniare?

22. What was seen (uisis) was ‘a great clapping of the hands,’
‘ magnus plausus-'3 what was signified ‘a great beating of the breast‚'
magnus planctus. Compare Florus 4. α. 45 ‘dux ipse et nocturna
imagine plausum theatri sui audiens in modum planctus circumsonatus!

23. ultra, of time, after a negative, cf. 88, Livy 2. 19. 2.
eernere, i.e. with the bodily vision, opposed to sic (24) in dreams.

25. nullas. As Pompey's ears only can be intended, the adj. is no
more than an emphatic non ‘not at all.' This peculiarity of expression,
best known from ‘nullus uenit’ (Cic. etc.) ‘he never came’ and other
similar phrases, is freely used by Lucan, cf. e.g. vlu 804 sq. ‘cin-
erumque tuorum, Ι Magne, metu nullas N.i1.i «calcemus harenas' (and
Heitl. p. 108 (Ο), but nowhere more freely than here. tuba, the
trumpet’s voice, cf. ‘ nec tuba sit sati uana querela mei ’ Prop. 2. 13· 20
and 72 n., sounding the night watches.

26. quies, i.e. dreams3 compare 22, 764.

28. paren, adj. (Crit. App.)· The accusatives depend on serat
quies to be supplied from l. 27, as a sheer ellipse is hardly ever found
with qu0?, unde& except where a dat. of the person is added as Hor.
Serm. 2. 5. 102 ‘ unde milti tam fortem tamque fidelem?’ populis,
‘compendious’ comparison‚ ‘like that of the multitude'3 cf. 144 n.
For the sense cf. JuV. 1. 15 sqq. ‘et nos {consilium dedimus Sullae,
priuatus ut altum Ι dormiret.'

· 31. fati, the inevitable parting. uterque, you and Rome,
which is half personified; see below, 373 n.

32. Compare V 792 sqq. (Cornelia) ‘non maesti pectora Magni Ι
sustinet amplexu dulci, non colla tenere, Ι extremusque perit tam longi
fructus amoris.’

33. The order is tu uadis uelut etc. Lucan, likelother Latin poets,
has frequent dislocations of words (hyperbaton), cf. 133, 685, 797 notes.

34. rati uoti ‘of her prayers being always fulfilled,’ cs. Prop.
4 (5). 10. 14 ‘uotis occupat ante 7·att's.’ The special reference is to
the prayers for Pompey’s recoveryin B.c. 50, Juv. ιο. 283 sqq. ‘ prouida
Pompeio dederat Campania febres Ι optandas, sed multae urbes et
publica uota Ι uicerunt.’
