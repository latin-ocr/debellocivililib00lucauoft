NoTEs. 5 3

2. 5ο ‘multus in eo proelio Caesar fuit mediusque inter inperatorem et

militem ς uoces quoque obequitantis exceptae, altera cruenta sed docta et
ad uictoriam efficax, ‘ miles, faciem feri ’ 3 altera ad iactationem composita

‘parce ciuibus ’ cumipse sequeretur.’ Florus is no friend to the Caesars.

32ο. imago ‘thought of affection ’ ⁴ natural feeling.' So Greek ἰδέα.
This is the meaning in Virg. Aen. 9. 294 ‘animum patriae strinxit
pluatis imagv’ as Henry points out. non qualifies una.

321. fronte as frons 220.

322. turbate is translated ‘disfigure’ by H. who quotes from the
lexx. Stat. Theb. 9. 745 ‘prima Tanagraeum turbauit harundo Coroe-
bum.’ We must have stronger evidence than this passage to give such
an unusual meaning to the verb. turbauit may well mean the same as
in ib. 9. 871 sq. ‘tunc miser et frenos turbatus et arma remisit, Ι uulneris
impatiens? explained by ib. 2. 671 ‘turbatique gradus! And here it
appears better to take it as ‘rout.' Cf. Ov. Met. 12. 133 sqq. ‘capulo
caua tempora pulsat Ι cedentemque sequens instat turbatque ruitque

'attonitoque negat requiem.’ uoltus may carry an allusion to the
‘faciem feri’ referred to in 575.

3²3 sq. mean ‘whether those whom he has to attack are kinsmen
or not.’

324. ib1t=iturus est. So uiolabit ‘whether his stroke is to harm
none dear to him.'

325. This line has often been taken with 323 sq. as meaning

‘whether he killed a kinsman or no, let him put down the slaughter of ·

the unknown enemy to his credit as a crime,' or in other words let him
pretend that he has killed a kinsman whether he has or not, in order to
gain the reward; and as a parallel is quoted the story of the soldier who
in the civil war between Vitellius and Vespasian asked to be rewarded
sor killing his brother, Tac. Hist. 3. 51. As, however, to say nothing of
the contorted sense, this is entirely at variance with the rest of Caesar’s
speech, Ι have followed Bentley’s interpretation in the main. He
explains the text by reference to a passage of Appian, which I quote
nearly entire in order to show its complete agreement with Lucan, 2. 74
καὶ τάδε μοι περὶ μόνων ἐστὶ τῶν Ἰταλῶν ἐπεὶ τῶν ’γε συμμάχων μηδὲ
φροντίζετε μηδ’ ἐν λόγῳ τίθεσθε μηδὲ μάχεσθε ὅλως ἐκείνοις-
ἔχεσθε οὖν τῶνἺταλῶν μόνων κᾶν οἱ σύμμαχοι δίκην κυνῶν περιθέωσιν
ὑμᾶς καὶ θορυβοποιῶσι. τρεψάμενοι δ’ αὐτούς, τῶνδε μὲν ὡς συγ·
’γενῶν φειδώμεθα τοὺς δὲ συμμάχους ἐς τὴν τῶνδε κατάπληξιν
ἐξεργασώμεθα. The orders then are ε to disregard the auxiliaries
until the legionaries are routed; when that is secured‚ to spare
