xxiv HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

its outlying posts, Pompey advanced into the plain till he
reached a position suitable for the execution of the manoeuvre
which was to give him the victory. His right wing, under the
command of Lentulus1‚ rested on a small stream2 whose preci-
pitous banks and the swampy ground which it had recently
deluged formed a sufficient protection against a flank attack³.

Here were the Cilician legion and the cohorts which Afranius ⁴

had brought from Spain4. Except for a small detachment of
600⁶, there were no cavalry on this wing. In the centre were
the steady Syrian legions with Scipio as commander. The left
wing, where Pompey himself commanded in chief, consisted of
the two legions which had been withdrawn from Caesar before
the outbreak of the war, under the immediate charge of the
fierce Domitius, while the rest of the legionaries filled the
space between the centre and the wingsss. The particulars of
Pompey's formations have been preserved. There were the
usual three lines, and each line was ten deep ⁷. On the extreme

2 The Enipeus according to some of our authorities: see note on
the topography.

3 For the floods see Lucan 224 and note. Compare also the words
of Plutarch just quoted πρὸς ἑλώδεσι χωρίοις.

4 These were of course legionaries (scutatz) and are not to be con-
fused with the light-armed caetrati, 23² note.

⁵ According to Frontinus, 500 according to Orosius and Eutropius,
Col. Stoffel perhaps rightly identifies them with the Pontic horse
of Lucan 226. This detachment, which played no part in the battle, is
not mentioned by Caesar quoted in note on 506.

⁶ ‘reliquas inter aciem mediam cornuaque interiecerat, numeroque
cohortes CX expleuerat,’ Caesar c. 88. 4.

⁷ By Frontinus Strat. 2. 3. 22 ‘Cn. Pompeius aduersus C. Caesarem
Palaepharsali triplicem instruxit aciem quarum singulae denos ordines
in latitudinem habuerunt. legiones secundum uirtutem cuiusque firmis-
simas in cornibus et in medio collocauit ; spatia his interposita tironibus
suppleuit?
