THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. xi ¹

memory 3 and facts are hard to hide. The eagerness of the .
Caesarians for battle sorts but ill with the length and elaborate-
, ness of their leader's speech ; and when in book vm the flying l
Q trembles at every rustle of the forest, we know what to j
think of the majestic calm, with which in book v11 he sustains
defeat.

It must not however be supposed that if a narrative of Lucan
cannot be accepted as it stands, it is therefore destitute of all
foundation. Exaggeration, suppression and distortion are in
general easier modes of perverting than sheer fabrication3 and a
close and critical examination may sometimes discover, even in
the wildest improbabilities‚ the vestiges of truth. For example‚J

 

the command of Caesar for the destruction of his camp seems at
first sight to be as wholly fictitious as it is utterly incredible;
but nevertheless it appears to be based on a real incident, and
perhaps on a real orderl. The pause before the battle was a
fact3 but to understand its nature and circumstances we must
discard the high—flown narrative of Lucan 2.

Even in the absence of all temptation to misstatement the
accuracy of Lucan cannot be relied upon. In every branch of
learning, history, geography, mythology, and science as it was
then understood, he was the possessor of vast stores of multi-

For some of his mistakes it is true he is not himself
primarily responsible. The confusion of the two great battle-
fields, the bullets that melt in their course, tthssmorrhage that

⁴ We cannot determine to whom is due the mistake in the move-
ments of the Pompeian horse (506n. ); and the numerical error in 219
(see the note) may have been in his copy of Livy. But if so, a careful
inquii-er would have probably detected it. bvax mm 00 t ³
