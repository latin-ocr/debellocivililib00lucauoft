76 LVCANI DE BELLO CIVILI LIB. V11.

‘Quid restat nisi cuncta nouo confundere luctu Ι insontesque meae
populos miscere ruinae? Ι euerso iuuat orbe mori (cf. 664 inf.) ; solacia leto!
exitium commune dabit.’ ,

658. uoluit. (Crit. App.) ‘ chose‚’ ‘desired‚' carrying out the idea of
uotis. solacia ‘alleviations‚’ not aggravations (654 sq.), of his
calamity. The Schol. says excellently ‘optauit solacia, quae ei essent
si solus occumbat.'

662. pignora ‘hostages.’ The Scholiast is excellent again, ‘in
quae saeuiant si meo sanguine delectentur?

664. orbe remoto ‘without the world‚’ 585 n. For Pompey's
vanity cf. 3 53. -

665. The sense is ‘There is nothing more 1 can be stripped of.
Fortune, why pursue your hatred farther Ρ ’

668. circumit ‘goes round to.’ Plautus plays on this and the other
sense ‘goes round' in Menaechm. 2. 1. 6 ‘an quasi mare omnes cir·
cumz‘mus insulas?’ matura ‘ dashing into death before the time';
cf, Sen. Oed. 71 ‘affusus aris supplices tendo manus Ι matura poscens
fata’3 [Tib.] Pan. Messal. 205 ‘seu matura dies fato properat mihi
mortem.' The passage of meaning, at first sight surpfising, is from
‘ripe’ or ‘ready,’ through ‘pressing‚' ‘urgent,' to ‘hurried‚' ‘coming
too soon?

669. tanti ‘ worth the sacrifice‚' ut in matura fata ruant. Lucan
has also the ‘inverted’ tanti, as we may call it, VI 768 ‘sit tanti
uixisse iterum,' ‘consider the sacrifice worth making? See sor both Juv-
10. 97, 13. 96 (with Mayor's notes). robur, i.e. animi, usually
added in prose, ‘fortitude'; ef. Seneca Oed. 78 ‘magno robore aerumnas
doma)

670. ire, i.e. ad eundum. Here, as seemingly elsewhere, e-g.
Prop. 1. 16. 7, when deesse is used with a complement in the inf„
a negative is prefixed.

675. ubicumque ‘everywhere‚’ cf. Ov. Am. 3. ιο. 5. So other com-
pounds of ·cumque; undecumque Sen., quacumque Virg. This use, like
the similar one of ὁστισοῦν, comes from an ellipse of the verb of the
dependent clause. seu (Crit. App), with the usual choice of
alternatives.

676 sq. ‘And that death in thy presence which the fates desired.’
The subj. is te praesente mori, to which ratis negatum is in appositiva.-
Editors have been misled by negatum in 1 70 sq. ‘summisque negatum Ι

stare diu‚’ where the part. and inf. form one notion. Cornelia was at some ’

distance from the scene of Pompey's murder.
