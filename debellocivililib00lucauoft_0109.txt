the Britanni Hor. carm. t. 35. 29 sq. ‘ultimos Ι orbis Britannos‚’ to the

the sun's conch, Stat. Silu. 3. 1. 183.

543. mc ⁴ they (lit. this) will be the Roman people.’ It is difficult
to set any limits to the so-called attraction of pronouns to the predicate,
cf. Prop. 2. 24. 50 sq. ‘uix uenit extremo qui legat ossa die. Ι Izi tibi nos
erimus.’

544. tatis. ‘The sates were allowed free course for Caesar.’ Though ts
destiny cannot be altered (except perhaps in minor respects, see thei
remarkable passage on the power of the Thessalian witches beginning*
‘si sata minora moueres ’ VI 605 sqq.)‚ yet its course can be arrested‚g
111 392 ‘quantum est quod sata tenentur! ’ (cf. 88, 295) or accelerated,
v 41 ‘fluorum impellite cursum' (cf. 52). See also Mr Heitland'si
examples pp. 44 sq. Consistency in speaking of fate is as difficult to ³
the world in general as correctness in referring to the earth’s motion
round its axis and sor much the same reason. The Stoics certainly did

H. cf. Virg. Aen. 11. 29ο.

548. sslic- Observe the change of pronoun. He returns to hic in
551, cf. also 229 sqq. auxiliis, the abl. will be used somewhat
differently, according as we make the noun mean ‘help ' (plur. because
regum is plur.) or ⁶ auxiliary forces.'

549. ferrumque. The negative, as often in Lucan, is carried on
from the previous clause. neque (or aut) would be used in prose, cf.
Heitl. Introd. p. ¹08 (β). mouere, cf. notes on 494, 767.

rogatae, cf. lv 233 sq. ‘Magne, paras acies mundique extrema
tenentes Ι sollicitas reges.'

551. tua olimina ‘the proofs of your guilt'; cf. 1x 1090 sq. ‘sed
non, ut crimina solum Ι uestra tegat tellus, iusto date tura sepulcro ’
