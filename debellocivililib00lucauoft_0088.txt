the tetrarch of Galatia, supported Pompey. reges, e.g. Ariarathes,
the king of Cappadocia. tyranni ‘sub quibus reges sunt et
tetrarchae ’ says the Schol. 3 but its precise force is not clear.

495·

229. Libye, cf. 111 293 sqq. creta, ib. 184 sqq.

2 31. Galli. Raucillus and Aegus, two chieftains of the Allobroges,
with their followers had deserted from Caesar. One of them fell in a
cavalry skirmish just before Pharsalia, Caesar B. C. 3. 59 sqq.‚ 84 fin.

ἀσπίδα θοῦριν. The ancients only threw away the shield when all
hope of fighting was over. commouit ‘ brandished.’ caetra

These Spanish targeteers from the defeated armies of Afranius and
Petreius, in which were ‘caetralae ulterioris Hispaniae cohortes circiter

came with the regular troops who are mentioned by Caesar in 3. 78
as posted on Pompey’s right ⁴ Ciliciensis legio coniuncta cum cohortibus

he did this has been lost) ‘in dextro cornu erant collocatae.’

had sent out three legions to forage the previous night. These discre-
pancies are quite unimportant.

gen. (of ‘cause ') is Silver Latin3 cf. F lor. 3. 17. 9 ‘Drusum...aegrum
