were alternatives and 747 stood in the margin. nec plura locutus seems
to me more characteristic of Lucan than sic milite iusso, which might
easily be made up from v. 736 ‘ imperium—miles'; see vn 615, 239,
382, also 11 490, 1v 544, V111 453 sq. ‘non plura locutus Ι inpulit huc
animos.’ Again 748 is not exaetly an order to the soldiers, but the
result of an order. Whether however Lucan wrote 747 must be doubt-
fu13 we can only say he might have ; for the language cf. besides VI111.c.‚
1 87, 1V 279. I retain it therefore, as at least giving the sense required.
'148 gladios is suspicions. Burman conjectured galeas, Heinsius clades ς
cf. crit. note on 489. 751 ruunt MU, uolunt BEVG, a natural cor·
ruption on which it appears unsafe to build. 754 impleuit. The
subject is not quite clear ; and hence the old conj. implerunt. imple-
bit (m), which can hardly be a correction, has more to recommend it, if
we place a comma after mentes and a longer stop after auri. The
subject of implebit will be v. 75 5, and its tense will agree with putabunt
(757). The superior vigour of this is obvious. But 1 have left the
vulgate. 755 expuit BE, expulit VUG, extulit M. 756 quodque
legit MBE, but the perfect seems necessary. 761 caesum ed. with G,
caecum Bl, uacuum Eb, stratum U (and over an erasure) MV. caesum
is at least as well supported as stratum (Hosius) for B's first reading
caecum is an obvious mistake for it and uacuum is a gloss on cassum,
another corruption of it (cassum-with the. same gloss is actually found
written over caesum in G), whereas M clearly did not read stratum
originally. stratum appears to bea conjecture and an unhappy one to
boot ; for Lucan, whose object is to cover up the luxury of the Pom-
peians‚ would not have used a word which suggested it. caesum on the
other hand (though perfectly correct, see ad loc.) would be difficult
to a scribe. [cassum. (Heinsius and Oudendorp) does not take an abl.
of the person] 765 miseris U⁴ Heinsius Oudendorp, miseri the other
MSS and edd., placing a stop at furentes. But against this is first the
tautology in uaesana quies and somni furentes, which is unendurable if
the sentence stops there, second the fact that the minds of the sleeping
Caesarians are (naturally) represented throughout as passive, whereas
miseri uersant involves mental activity (cf. Virg. quoted ad loc.).
768 putes G some edd., but putem is quite correct, cf. v 610 crediderim.
nocentes several edd., perhaps rightly, cf. Ovid's words quoted ad
loc. 796 omitted by M1U1G1; apparently a marginal addition
by some one who thought, not unnaturally‚ that the brutal conduct
ascribed to Caesar required some explanation. 801 hoste ME, hostes
the other MSS, an easier reading. 816 eunt BEUm, sunt M¹VG
